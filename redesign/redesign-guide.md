**Salutations!**

Thank you to the amazing team of people who made Sociocracy what it is today! My work would not be possible without your dedication and sacrifice. 

The map is in need of a major redesign.
My goal with this was to:

 - make a mobile device friendly UI/UX
 - make it accessible for people with disabilities
 - add a search feature to the map

I hope you like it. Please feel free to make changes to the Figma file. Contributions are always welcome here!
