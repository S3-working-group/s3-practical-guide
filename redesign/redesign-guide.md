**Salutations!**

Thank you to the amazing team of people who made Sociocracy what it is today! My work would not be possible without your dedication and sacrifice. 

I believe that the map could be improved.
My goals were:

 - make a mobile device friendly UI/UX
 - make it accessible for people with disabilities
 - add a search feature to the map

I hope you like it. Please feel free to make changes to the Figma file. Contributions are always welcome here!
