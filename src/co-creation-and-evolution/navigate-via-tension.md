## Navigate Via Tension

### ...for identifying and accounting for organizational drivers.

**All members** bring awareness to what might help or harm the organization, and aim to account for drivers in an effective way. 

A **tension** is a personal experience: a symptom of dissonance between an individual's perception and their expectations (or preferences). 

**Challenges and opportunities** for an organization are revealed as people become aware of tensions they experience in relation to them.

To **discover drivers**, look behind tensions and describe what's happening and what's needed. Sometimes our inquiry reveals misconceptions and the tension goes away.

Awareness of **organizational drivers** can be passed to an appropriate domain to be addressed.
