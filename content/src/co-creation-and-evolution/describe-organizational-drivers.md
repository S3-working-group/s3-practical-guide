# Describe Organizational Drivers

**Describe organizational drivers to understand, communicate and remember them.**

A simple way to describe a driver is with a **brief statement** explaining: 

-   **What’s happening...:**
    -   the **current situation**
    -   the **effect** of this situation on the organization
-   ...and **what’s needed:**
    -   the **need** of the organization in relation to this situation
    -   the **impact** of attending to that need

# Describe Organizational Drivers (…)

Depending on their perspective, a person or group may decide to describe a driver as a problem to solve or an opportunity to leverage. 

{{define:driver-statement}}

The driver statement contains just enough information to communicate the need for an action or a decision. Typically a driver statement can be summed up in one or two sentences.

More information about the scope and details of the driver may be recorded besides the initial driver statement.

## Example driver statement: 

> _“The kitchen is a mess: there are no clean cups, the sink is full of dishes and it’s not possible to quickly grab a coffee and get right back to work. We need the kitchen in a usable state so we can stay focused on our work.”_

---

## 1. Current Situation

> _“The kitchen is a mess: there are no clean cups, the sink is full of dishes...”_

Describe the current situation:

- Briefly capture the essentials of what is happening.
- Be objective: Describe observations and avoid evaluation.

## 2. Effect

> _“...it’s not possible to quickly grab a coffee and get right back to work.”_

Explain the effect of this situation on the organization:

- Clarify **why** the situation needs attention: how does it affect the organization? 
- Be explicit about effects being current or anticipated. 
- Explain challenges, losses, opportunities or gains. 

---

## 3. Need

> _“We need the kitchen in a usable state...”_

Explain the need of the organization in relation to this situation:

- A **need of an organization** is anything a group (or individual) needs to effectively account for a domain. 
- When there’s disagreement about the need(s), it’s helpful to zoom out from specific solutions.
- Be specific on whose need it is (“we need”, “they need”, “I need”) .
- Avoid describing specific solutions disguised as needs.

---

## 4. Impact

> _“...so we can stay focused on our work”._

Describe the impact of attending to that need:

- Explain intended outcome, potential benefits or opportunities.
- The impact may be obvious or implicit, especially when the effects of the current situation are already described.
