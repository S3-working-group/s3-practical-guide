## Describe Organizational Drivers

**Describe organizational drivers to understand, communicate and remember them.**

Describing [drivers](glossary:organizational-driver) may be done by a group or by an individual. Depending on their perspective, they may decide to explain a driver as a **problem** to solve or an **opportunity** to leverage.

A simple way to describe a driver is by explaining:

-   **What’s happening...:**
    -   the **current situation**
    -   the **effect** of this situation on the organization
-   ...and **what’s needed:**
    -   the **need** of the organization in relation to this situation
    -   the **impact** of attending to that need

Create a brief but comprehensive summary containing just enough information to clearly communicate the need for an action or a decision.

### Example: 

> _“The kitchen is a mess: there are no clean cups, the sink is full of dishes and it’s not possible to quickly grab a coffee and get right back to work. We need the kitchen in a usable state so we can stay focused on our work.”_

### 1. Current Situation

> _“The kitchen is a mess: there are no clean cups, the sink is full of dishes...”_

Describe the current situation:

- Briefly capture the essentials of what is happening, and, if necessary, the context in which it occurs.
- Be objective - describe observations and avoid evaluation.

### 2. Effect

> _“...it’s not possible to quickly grab a coffee and get right back to work.”_

Explain the effect of this situation on the organization:

- Clarify **why** the situation needs attention: how does it affect the organization? 
- Be explicit about whether the effects are current or anticipated. 
- Explain challenges, losses, opportunities or gains. 

### 3. Need

> _“We need the kitchen in a usable state...”_

Explain the [need](glossary:need) of the organization in relation to this situation:

- A **need of an organization** is anything a team (or individual) requires to effectively account for a [domain](glossary:domain). 
- Be specific on whose need it is (“we need”, “they need”, “I need”).
- If there’s disagreement about the need, it helps to zoom out from specific solutions and focus on what the organization is lacking in this situation.

### 4. Impact

> _“...so we can stay focused on our work”._

Describe the impact of attending to that need:

- Explain the [intended outcome](glossary:intended-outcome), potential benefits or opportunities.
- The impact may be obvious or implicit, especially when the effects of the current situation are already described.

### Summarize the Driver

Aim for one or two sentences, so that the information is easy to remember and process.

Besides the summary, more details about the driver may be kept in the logbook.
 

### Review Drivers

Make sure to review drivers on a regular basis, to deepen you understanding of what's happening and needed.

Helpful questions for a review include:

-   Is the description of the situation (still) correct?
-   Do we still associate the same needs with the situation?
-   Is the driver still within our domain?
-   Is the driver still relevant?
