# Governance Agreements

{{define:governance-agreement}}


Shared guidelines about why, how, and when to act, as well as what is specifically required, enable effective collaboration.

A governance agreement is created to fulfill a requirement that has been determined as suitable to respond to an [organizational driver](glossary:organizational-driver). Itâ€™s recommended that all agreements are **regularly reviewed** and evolved as necessary, based on learning. The decision about a requirement should also be regularly reviewed.

**Overall accountability** for a governance agreement lies with the people that make them.

A governance agreement can include **delegation of specific responsibilities** to individuals or groups.
