Sociocracy 3.0 — a.k.a. "S3" — is **social technology** for evolving agile and resilient organizations at any size, from small start-ups to large international networks and multi-agency collaboration. 

In this practical guide you'll discover a comprehensive collection of tried and tested **concepts, principles and practices for improving performance, engagement and wellbeing** in organizations.

Since its launch in 2015, Sociocracy 3.0 has been helping people in start-ups, small and medium businesses, large international organizations, investor-funded and nonprofit organizations, families and communities.

Using S3 can **help you to achieve your objectives** and successfully navigate complexity. You can make changes one step at a time, **without the need for sudden radical reorganization** or planning a long-term change initiative:

-   Simply start with identifying your areas of greatest need and select one or more practices or guidelines that help.
-   Proceed at your own pace, and develop both your skills and a more sociocratic and agile mindset as you go.

**Regardless of your position in the organization**, you'll find many proven ideas that are relevant and helpful for you.
 
#### How does Sociocracy 3.0 help? [a]

S3 integrates core concepts and practices found in agile methodologies, lean management, Kanban (and KMM), Design Thinking, Teal Organizations and the family of sociocracy-based governance methods (SCM/Dynamic Governance, Holacracy® etc.). It's complimentary and compatible with any agile or lean framework, including but not limited to Scrum and its various scaling frameworks.

**Inside this book you'll discover a coherent collection of 70+ practices and guidelines** to help you navigate complexity and improve collaboration:

-   **Simple, facilitated formats** that support teams in drawing on the collective intelligence of the group and incrementally processing available information into continuous improvement of work processes, products, services and skills.
-   **Group-practices** to help organizations make the best use of talent they already have, through **people supporting each other** in building skills, accountability and engagement.
-   Simple **tools for clarifying who does what**, freeing people up to decide and act for themselves as much as possible, within clearly defined constraints that enable experimentation and development.
-   Patterns for **growing organizational structure beyond hierarchies** into flexible, decentralized networks where the flow of information and influence directly supports the creation of value.

#### A few things you should know [b]

This practical guide to Sociocracy 3.0 is written and published by the three co-developers of Sociocracy 3.0. 

All content inside this book is also available under a Creative Commons license. However, we've decided to make this book available for purchase as a **Supporter Edition** because over the years people have been asking for ways to support the ongoing development of Sociocracy 3.0.

True to the mindset behind S3, this book will always be a work in progress that grows and changes as we learn from people who are experimenting with S3 in organizations around the world. Since we started out 5 years ago, we have released several updates per year and we'll continue to do so in the years to come.

Even though several sections in this book are brief and may still be rough around the edges, this book has been sufficient for many people to get started with S3 and achieve positive change in their organizations. We hope it will also be of value for you.
