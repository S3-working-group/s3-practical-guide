# Principle 1 – Clarify Purpose


**_Ensure that everyone understands who the organization or team is serving, why and to what end, so that everyone is able to focus and unite their efforts on achieving that purpose._**


Essential Patterns to help you achieve this:

-   [Describe Organizational Drivers](section:describe-organizational-drivers) –  Understanding the situation that is motivating action is an essential component for understanding, defining, and communicating the purpose of an organization, a team, or a department.
-   [Determine Requirements](section:determine-requirements) - Clarifying the main requirement an organization or team is fulfilling helps people develop a shared understanding of direction for their contribution.
