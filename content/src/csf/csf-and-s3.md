# If You Are Familiar with Sociocracy 3.0 (S3)


Through our work describing, explaining, and helping people apply S3 patterns to solve problems and respond to opportunities in teams and organizations, we gained a deeper understanding of the underlying common sense that guides people toward building more successful organizations.

The more people become aware of this common sense, the more they can use it to develop ways together that help both them, and the organization, to thrive.

**The Common Sense Framework helps to make S3 more accessible to people**: The 10 principles are easy to grasp and remember, and provide a simple navigation system through the 74 patterns that guides people on where to start, and which patterns to use.
