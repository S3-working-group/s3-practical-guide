# Principle 7 – Collaborate on Dependencies


**_Co-create and evolve a coherent system to deal with all dependencies, so that you deliver value fast when dependencies cannot be avoided._**

Essential patterns to help you achieve this:

-   [Navigate via Tension](section:navigate-via-tension) – Everyone in the organization paying attention to dependencies maximizes the potential for unmanaged dependencies to be identified and responded to.
-   [Clarify and Develop Domains](section:clarify-and-develop-domains) – When people understand their own areas of responsibility, and those of others too, they also understand where collaboration on dependencies will be necessary.
-   [Visualize Work](section:visualize-work) – Visualizing work items and the dependencies between them makes it easier to manage dependencies in cooperation with the relevant stakeholders. 
-   [Respond to Organizational Drivers](section:respond-to-organizational-drivers) – Understanding why a dependency exists in the first place, and ensuring it is taken care of, is essential for collaborating on managing or resolving dependencies. 
-   [Involve Those Affected](section:involve-those-affected) – To address dependencies in an effective way, it often helps to gather the perspectives of all (relevant) stakeholders and involve them in the decision-making process.
-   [Linking](section:linking) – Dependencies between two teams can often be addressed effectively by sending a [Representative](section:representative) to the decision-making of the other team, to ensure all relevant perspectives are considered and ownership of decisions is shared.
-   [Delegate Circle](section:delegate-circle) – When teams depend on each other, they can delegate the power to make and evolve agreements relating to specific dependencies to a circle of [Representatives](section:representative), to bring together relevant perspectives and generate ownership among all represented teams.
-   [Align Flow](section:align-flow) – Moving decision-making close to where value is created brings together the people necessary for making decisions in response to specific dependencies and eliminates unnecessary decision-making bottlenecks.
-   [Create a Pull-System for Organizational Change](section:create-a-pull-system-for-organizational-change) – Invite and enable the people affected by dependencies to make changes to organizational structure, to address those dependencies and facilitate the ongoing evolution of a coherent and effective organization.
