# Principle 5 – Run Experiments


**_Run experiments to address complex challenges, so that you learn how to move closer to where you want to be._**

Essential patterns to help you achieve this:

-   [Describe Organizational Drivers](section:describe-organizational-drivers) – Building a shared mental model of the situation you want to address is essential for successfully designing, running, and later on evaluating experiments.
-   [Determine Requirements](section:determine-requirements) - CClarifying the requirement, including the anticipated impact of fulfilling that requirement, is a prerequisite for designing the experiment, and for determining metrics for success.
-   [Clarify Intended Outcome](section:clarify-intended-outcome) – A clear description of the intended outcome of an experiment is essential for understanding whether or not an experiment produced the intended result.
-   [Evaluation Criteria](section:evaluation-criteria) – Defining clear criteria for determining success before the start of an experiment, helps to reveal flaws in its design and supports effective evaluation of outcomes. 
-   [Consent Decision-Making](section:consent-decision-making) – An effective group process for viewing a proposition from a diversity of perspectives, and for testing whether or not an experiment is good enough and safe enough to run.
-   [Evaluate and Evolve Agreements](section:evaluate-and-evolve-agreements) – An experiment needs to be regularly reviewed to determine what outcomes it achieves, and, as a consequence, potentially adapted, or even stopped.
-   [Limit Work in Progress](section:limit-work-in-progress) – Limit the number of concurrent experiments to avoid overwhelm and maintain a steady flow of value. 
-   [Create A Pull-System for Organizational Change](section:create-a-pull-system-for-organizational-change) – Inviting and enabling people to run experiments when they discover organizational requirements supports an effective and decentralized approach to organizational development.
