-   [Agree on Values](section:agree-on-values) – Agreement on fundamental guidelines for behavior in the organization defines ethical parameters for action and facilitates coherence.
-   [Evaluate and Evolve Agreements](section:evaluate-and-evolve-agreements) – Regular review and intentional evolution of agreements relating to culture keeps them alive in the consciousness of the people and helps identify when and how these agreements can be improved.
-   [Contract for Successful Collaboration](section:contract-for-successful-collaboration) – Co-creating mutually beneficial agreements for collaboration from the start supports building and maintaining an engaging and productive working environment and a culture of trust between parties.
