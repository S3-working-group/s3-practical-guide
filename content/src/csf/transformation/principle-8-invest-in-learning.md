# Principle 8 – Invest in Learning


**_Support everyone in developing their competence and skill, so that their contribution remains valuable and the organization can evolve._**

Essential patterns to help you achieve this:

-   [Navigate via Tension](section:navigate-via-tension) – Everyone in the organization paying attention for situations where growing competence and skills may be valuable focuses the learning effort and facilitates continuous improvement.
-   [Evaluate Meetings](section:evaluate-meetings) – A brief evaluation at the end of each meeting or workshop helps people identify their strengths, growing edges, and ways to improve their contribution in the future.
-   [Peer Review](section:peer-review) – When teams or people in roles regularly invite relevant stakeholders for a review of their effectiveness, they can learn about their strengths and growing edges, and identify ways they can improve their contribution in the future.
-   [Development Plan](section:development-plan) – Collaborating with relevant stakeholders on a plan for how to develop necessary skills and competence is an effective way of focusing the learning efforts of a person in a role, or for a team.
-   [Peer Feedback](section:peer-feedback) – Inviting feedback from peers supports people in understanding their strengths and growing edges, so that they can invest in learning where helpful.
