## Helping Team

**Bring together a group of equivalent people with the mandate to execute on a specific set of requirements defined by a delegator.**

A helping team: 

-   is a way for a delegator to expand their capacity
-   may be self-organizing, or guided by a coordinator chosen by the delegator
-   is governed by the delegator
-   benefits from a clearly defined domain

Members of the helping team:

-   can object to the delegator's decisions that affect them
-   can add items to the delegator's governance backlog
-   may be invited to select a representative to participate in the governance decision making of the delegator
