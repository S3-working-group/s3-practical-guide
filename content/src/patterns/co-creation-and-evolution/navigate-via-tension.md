# Navigate via Tension

<summary>
**Pay attention to tension you experience in relation to the organization, investigate the cause and pass on any organizational drivers you discover to the people accountable for the appropriate domain.**
</summary>

**Challenges and opportunities** for an organization are revealed by people bringing awareness to the reasons why they experience tension.

**Note:** In this context, a _tension_ is a personal experience: a symptom of dissonance between an individual's perception of a situation, and their expectations (or preferences).

To **discover drivers**, investigate what stimulates tension, and describe what's happening and what's needed. Sometimes an inquiry reveals misconceptions and the tension goes away.

When passing on a driver to another domain, it is often enough to communicate what is happening and why you think it matters (the effect on the organization). Let those responsible think about what's needed and what to do about it.
