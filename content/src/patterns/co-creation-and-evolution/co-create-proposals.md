## Co-Create Proposals

<summary>
**Bring people together to co-create proposals in response to organizational drivers: tap collective intelligence, build sense of ownership and increase engagement and accountability.**

There are many ways to co-create proposals. They typically follow a similar pattern:

1. Agree on the [driver](glossary:organizational-driver) (or problem / opportunity / need)
2. Explore the topic and understand constraints
3. Generate ideas
4. Design a proposal (often done by a smaller group)

One way to co-create proposals is to use S3's [Proposal Forming](section:proposal-forming) pattern.

For inspiration for steps 2 and 3, look to classic group facilitation techniques or design thinking activities.

Besides in a face-to-face workshop, you can adapt this process for online meetings. You can even use it asynchronously (and over an extended period of time) to include many people.
