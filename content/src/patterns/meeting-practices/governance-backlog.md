A governance backlog is at the core of any reliable and transparent system for governance. Keeping a governance backlog helps with planning regular [governance meetings](section:governance-meeting). Itâ€™s also useful for deciding which items are best addressed in a dedicated meeting, or in other regular meetings such as product meetings, [planning meetings](section:planning-and-review-meetings) or [retrospectives](section:retrospective).

A governance backlog contains information about:

-   Drivers that need a [Requirement](glossary:requirement)
-   Requirements that need a proposal
-   Proposals that need a decision
-   Agreements due review (according to an agreed upon evaluation date)
-   Possible objections to existing agreements or actions that need to be tested and, if they qualify, resolved
-   Selecting people for roles
-   Short reports pertaining to past decisions and the ongoing governance of the domain

An item in a (prioritized) governance backlog typically provides information about: 


-   the item that needs addressing 
-   the next step(s) for addressing the item (e.g. [determine requirement](section:determine-requirements), [form a proposal](section:proposal-forming), [test a proposal](section:consent-decision-making), [review an existing agreement](section:evaluate-and-evolve-agreements), [select someone for a role](section:role-selection). [Test arguments](section:test-arguments-qualify-as-objections) and [resolve objections)](section:resolve-objection)
-   an estimate of the time required
-   what people need to do to prepare
-   other interdependent items (including work items), as well as any other relevant information, e.g. reference to proposals, domain descriptions, etc.
-   who added the item to the backlog (for clarification/questions)
-   a due date (if necessary)
-   the priority of the item (see [Prioritized Backlog](section:prioritize-backlogs))
-
