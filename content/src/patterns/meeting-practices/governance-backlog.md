# Governance Backlog

<summary>
A **governance backlog** is a visible, prioritized list of items (drivers) that are related to governing a domain and require attention.
</summary>

A governance backlog contains:

-   matters requiring a decision
-   proposals to create and consider
-   selecting people for roles

**Note:** Upcoming reports and agreements due review are usually added directly to the agenda (rather than the backlog).
