# Governance Backlog

<summary>
Keep a dedicated [backlog](glossary:backlog) for items that require a governance decision, so that you can remember them and use the information to plan and organize your governance.

{{**Definition**: A **governance backlog** is a visible, prioritized list of items (drivers and/or requirements) relating to the governance of a domain.}}

A governance backlog is at the core of any reliable and transparent system for governance. Keeping a governance backlog helps with planning regular [governance meetings](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/governance-meeting.html). It’s also useful for deciding which items are best addressed in a dedicated meeting, or in other regular meetings such as product meetings, [planning meetings](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/planning-and-review-meetings.html) or [retrospectives](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/retrospective.html).

A governance backlog contains information about:

-   matters requiring a decision
-   proposals to create and consider
-   selecting people for roles

An item in a (prioritized) governance backlog typically provides information about: 

- the [driver](glossary:organizational-driver) that needs addressing (and the [requirement](glossary:requirement)—for drivers that have been determined as relevant and a priority)
- the next step(s) for addressing the item (e.g. [determine requirement](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/determine-requirements.html), form a proposal, [test a proposal](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/consent-decision-making.html), [review an existing agreement](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/evaluate-and-evolve-agreements.html), [select someone for a role](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/role-selection.html), including an estimate of the time required
- other interdependent items (including work items), as well as any other relevant information, e.g. reference to proposals, domain descriptions, etc)
- who added the item to the backlog (for clarification/questions)
- a due date (if necessary)
- a way of visualizing rank or priority (see [Prioritized Backlog](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/prioritize-backlogs.html)).
