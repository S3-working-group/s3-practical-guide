Some considerations for successfully preparing a meeting:

- clarify and communicate the [driver](glossary:organizational-driver) for, and [intended outcome](glossary:intended-outcome) of the meeting
- decide who to invite
- create an agenda
- schedule the meeting enough in advance, so people have time to prepare
- choose an appropriate duration for the meeting
- be clear who will [facilitate the meeting](section:facilitate-meetings), who will take minutes and who will take care of any follow-up

## Preparing an Agenda

Involve people in preparing and prioritizing an agenda and send it out in advance

For each agenda item agree on:

- the driver
- the intended outcome
- the process
- the time you want to spend on it
- what people need to do to prepare

## Support the Participants' Preparation

- consider what can be done in advance to prepare for the meeting
- notify people about any expectations and prerequisites
- make any resources available that people may need for preparation

## As a participant

- consider the pattern [Artful Participation](section:artful-participation)
- review the agenda and consider how you can contribute to each item
- bring up objections to an agenda, and if possible resolve them before the meeting
- review improvement suggestions from the last meeting's evaluation and consider how **you** might act on them
