# Governance Meeting

<summary>
When you share responsibility for governance with others, regularly make time to hold structured and facilitated meetings to address a domain’s governance so that challenges and opportunities are addressed in a timely manner and policies can be evaluated and improved frequently.
</summary>

In the case of a single individual attending to a domain without the need to involve others, it’s still valuable to schedule time for governance on a regular basis to develop your own policies that enable you to be and remain effective.

The main purpose of people’s efforts in any domain is to deliver value to the people they serve. This is mostly achieved during day-to-day activities ([operations).]() However, for operations to be and remain effective and efficient, it is essential to regularly take time to deal with matters of [governance](): deciding on *how* you do things, evaluating the effectiveness of your policies, and addressing challenges and opportunities that are beyond the scope of individual work items. These activities often get lost when the operational workload is overwhelming, and deadlines are looming, which can lead to increased stress over time, systemic challenges not being addressed, and opportunities being missed.

Scheduling a regular Governance Meeting for a domain ensures that the time for governance is set aside and that all people who are responsible for making significant decisions (e.g. team members, [delegators](glossary:delegator), or [representatives](section:representative) from other domains) can be present. This way, you can make and evolve the necessary decisions in a timely manner and create and evolve policies that address challenges and opportunities as they arise so that operations run smoothly over time.

Having a structured and facilitated meeting and adhering to a clear and prioritized [agenda](section:prioritize-backlogs) supports a group to stay focused and productive. Adding a [timebox]() to an agenda item helps keep discussions focused and ensure that decisions are made in a timely manner. If certain items are taking too long to resolve, review their priority and consider whether additional information or resources are needed to progress.


## The structure of a governance meeting

A governance meeting is usually:


-   facilitated
-   prepared in advance
-   [timeboxed](section:timebox-activities) for a duration of 90-120 minutes
-   scheduled every 2-4 weeks

A typical governance meeting includes the following phases:



1. Opening: [check in](section:check-in) with each other and attune to the objective of the meeting
2. Administrative matters
    -   Check for consent to the previous meeting’s minutes
    -   Agree on a date for the next meeting
    -   Check for any last-minute agenda items and for consent to the agenda
3. Agenda items (see below)
4. [Meeting evaluation](section:evaluate-meetings): reflect on your interactions, celebrate successes and share suggestions for improvement
5. Closing: Check in with each other before you leave the meeting.

## Roles involved in a governance meeting:


-   The [Meeting Host]() is responsible for the preparation and follow-up of the governance meeting.
-   The [Logbook Keeper]() records details of decisions, and keeps those records up to date and organized
-   The [Governance Facilitator]()


## Agenda Items

Typical **agenda items** include:

-   Any short reports
-   Evaluation of existing [policies](glossary:policy) (including domains) due review
-   [Testing objections](section:test-arguments-qualify-as-objections) and, if they qualify, [resolving them](section:resolve-objections)
-   [Determining requirements](section:determine-requirements)
-   [Forming proposals](section:co-create-proposals)
-   [Deciding on policy](section:consent-decision-making)
-   [Designing domains](section:clarify-and-develop-domains) and deciding how to attend to domains (e.g. with new [roles](section:role), [circles](section:circle) or any other type of team)
-   [Selecting people for roles](section:role-selection)

For each agenda item, consider including the following details, to ensure clarity and help streamline preparations for the meeting:


-   A **description** of the item
-   An** item owner**, who is able to present the item and respond to questions 
-   What people should do to **[prepare in advance](section:prepare-meetings)**
    -   Specific actions
    -   Who to reach out to for clarifications
    -   Links to any relevant documentation
-   Which** process(es)** are required
-   A **[timebox]()** (how long you intend to spend on this item)
-   What **[outcome]()** you wish to achieve in the meeting.
