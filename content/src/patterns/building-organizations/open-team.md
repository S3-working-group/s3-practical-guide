# Open Team

<summary>
**Intentionally account for a domain by invitation rather than assignment, and request that those invited contribute when they can.**
</summary>

{{define:open-team}}

The [delegator](glossary:delegator) of the domain creates an invitation that clarifies:

- the [primary driver](glossary:primary-driver), key responsibilities and constraints of the open team's domain
- who is invited to contribute (the members of the open team)
- constraints relating to the delegator's participation in the open team's [governance](glossary:governance)

Depending on the constraints set by the delegator, contributors may only [organize and do work](glossary:operations), or take part in governance as well.

The delegator is accountable for conducting regular reviews to support effectiveness of work and any decision-making in the open team.
