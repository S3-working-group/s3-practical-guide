Governance decisions made in a delegate circle are acted upon in the various [domains](glossary:domain) it serves.

Delegate circles provide a way of steering organizations in alignment with the [flow of value](glossary:flow-of-value), and bring a diversity of perspectives to governance decision-making.

A delegate circle may bring in other people (e.g. external experts) to help with specific decisions, or even as a member of the circle.
