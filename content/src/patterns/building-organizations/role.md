# Role

<summary>
**Delegate responsibility for a domain to individuals.**
</summary>

A role is an area of responsibility (a [domain](glossary:domain)) that is [delegated](glossary:delegation) to an individual (the **role keeper**), who has autonomy to decide and act within the constraints of the role's domain.

The role keeper leads in creating a [strategy](glossary:strategy) for how they will account for their domain. They evolve their strategy in collaboration with the [delegator](glossary:delegator).

A role is a simple way for an organization (or [team](glossary:team)) to delegate recurring tasks or a specific area of work and decision-making to one of its members.

- people can take responsibility for more than one role
- instead of formally setting up a new team, it's sometimes simpler to just share one role between several people
- role keepers are selected by consent and for a limited term
- peers support one another to develop in the roles they keep

A role keeper may maintain a governance [backlog](glossary:backlog), and a [logbook](glossary:logbook) to record and help them evolve their approach toward delivering [value](glossary:value).

**Note:** In S3, guidelines, processes or protocols created by individuals in roles are treated as agreements.
