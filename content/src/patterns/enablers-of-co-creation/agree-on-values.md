# Agree On Values

<summary>
Intentionally evolve the culture in your organization.

{{define:values}}

-   each member brings their own values to an organization based on personal experiences and beliefs
-   a team or organization may **choose to collectively adopt values** to guide their collaboration

Values offer guidance to determine appropriate action, even in the absence of explicit [agreements](glossary:agreement).

Collectively adopting a set of values supports the effectiveness of an organization:

-   reduces potential for **misunderstanding**
-   helps to **align** decision-making and action
-   **attracts new members, partners and customers** who are aligned with the organization

Chosen values are an agreement that benefits from **regular review**.
