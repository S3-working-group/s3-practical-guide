# Breaking Agreements

<summary>
Break agreements when you are certain the benefit for the organization outweighs the cost of waiting to amend that agreement first, and take responsibility for any consequences.
</summary>

Breaking [agreements](glossary:governance-agreement) is sometimes **necessary** but may come at a **cost** to the community.

Be accountable:

-   **clean up** disturbances
-   **follow up** as soon as possible with those affected
-   **change the agreement** instead of repeatedly breaking it
