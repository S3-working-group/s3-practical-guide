Individuals, teams and entire organizations can acknowledge interdependence and intentionally invite people from outside their system to bring in **knowledge, experience and influence** to assist with decision-making and support collective learning.

-   **Representatives of affected parties** can inform and influence decision-making in ways that benefit overall objectives (see [Involve Those Affected](section:involve-those-affected))
