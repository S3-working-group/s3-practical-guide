Regular review of agreements is an essential practice for a learning organization:

-   adapt agreements to suit changing context
-   integrate learning to make them more effective

Ensure all [policies](glossary:policy) have an appropriate review date.

Evaluating agreements can be as simple as checking that an agreement is still relevant, and there is no objection to keeping it as it is.

Agreements are often reviewed in [Governance Meetings](section:governance-meeting), however sometimes it's more effective to schedule a dedicated session.

Adjust review frequency as necessary, and review early if required.

Elements of this pattern can also be used by individuals to evaluate decisions they make.

## Short Format

-   _How has this agreement helped us?_
-   _Is there any reason to drop this agreement?_
-   _How can this agreement be improved?_
-   Agree on a next review date.

## Long Format
