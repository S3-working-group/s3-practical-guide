# Navigate via Tension

<summary>
Pay attention to tension you experience in relation to the organization, investigate the cause and pass on any organizational drivers you discover to the people accountable for the appropriate domain.
</summary>

**Challenges and opportunities** for an organization are revealed by people bringing awareness to the reasons why they experience tension.


### Notice tension 

In this context, _tension_ is an inner state of alert: a personal experience that’s triggered when there's some kind of dissonance between an individual’s perception of a situation, and what they expect or would prefer to see.


### Understand situation

Investigate** the situation** that stimulates tension in you. Sometimes this inquiry can reveal misconceptions and the tension goes away. (see [Describe Organizational Drivers](section:describe-organizational-drivers))


### Is this an Organizational Driver?

A simple way to determine whether a driver is relevant for the organization is by asking the question: 

_Would responding to this situation help the organization to generate value, eliminate waste or avoid undesirable consequences?_


-   If you think the answer is **yes**, it’s likely you’ve identified an organizational driver that needs a response.
-   If you think the answer is **no**, you can ignore the situation and focus on relevant things instead. 
-   If you are **unclear**, investigate further, which might include reaching out to others who could have a clearer idea.


### Is it in my/our domain? If not, pass it on

It could be that the driver falls within the scope of your domain, in which case you’ll want to place it in your list of priorities and respond to it accordingly (see [Respond to Organizational drivers](section:respond-to-organizational-drivers). Even if it does fall outside of your area of responsibility, it might still be something that you are best placed to deal with, or at the very least can take care of without causing harm, in which case, consider just doing it. It might not be worth the effort to go and find somebody else and explain to them about the situation if it’s something you can simply deal with yourself.

On other occasions however, you’ll come across drivers that are the responsibility of others to respond to, in which case, you’ll need to pass the information on to them. 

To Navigate Via Tension effectively, there needs to be enough clarity around who is responsible for what in the organization so that people know, or can find out, who to inform.
