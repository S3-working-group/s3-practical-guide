## Proposal Forming Steps

**1. Present and Consent to Driver and Requirement:** Check the driver and requirement is summarized clearly enough and is relevant for the group to respond to. 

**2. Questions about the driver and Requirement:** Deepen individual and shared understanding of the driver and Requirement.

**3. Considerations as questions:** Collect any considerations you have in relation to possible solutions. Record them in the form of questions.

**4. Answer information gathering questions:** Gather any information regarding constraints and specific details that are worthwhile to consider.

**5. Prioritize generative questions:** Identify priority considerations to clarify which are more or less important to consider when forming the proposal.

**6. Collect ideas:** Generate and record ideas about how to respond to the driver and fulfill the determined requirement.

**7. Choose tuners:** Delegate responsibility for putting together a proposal, to 2-3 people (tuners).

When choosing Tuners, consider expertise, outside view, and inspiration, and the following questions:

-   who should be there?
-   who wants to be there?
-   who else may have a valuable contribution to make?

Between two and three tuners is usually appropriate. Remember to check for any objections to the proposed tuner(s).

**8. Design proposal:** The Tuners design a proposal.A well written proposal usually includes:


-   the Driver it responds to
-   the proposal text - what, how, rationale, etc.
-   who will be responsible for what - for overseeing its application / implementation
-   evaluation date or frequency - when the future agreement will be reviewed
-   evaluation criteria - to measure / determine the success or effectiveness of the decision
-   (a due date if necessary)
