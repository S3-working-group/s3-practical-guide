# Organizational Structure

Organizational structure is the actual arrangement of [domains](glossary:domain) and their connections. It reflects where power to influence is located, and the channels through which information and influence flow.

Continuously evolve your organization's structure to:

-   support the continuous [flow of value](glossary:flow-of-value)
-   enable effective collaboration around dependencies
-   ensure information is available to those who need it
-   distribute resources and power to influence as required

The basic building blocks for organizational structure are interdependent, connected domains.

Domains can be linked to form a hierarchy or a **heterarchy** (a.k.a. complex adaptive system, or network, where multiple functional structures can co-exist).

SociocracyÂ 3.0 describes a variety of **structural patterns** to grow organizational structure.

-   S3's structural patterns apply to different layers of abstraction
-   different structural patterns serve different [drivers](glossary:organizational-driver)
-   structural patterns can be adapted and combined as needed
-   more patterns are out there and will be discovered
