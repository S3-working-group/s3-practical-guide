# Peer Feedback

<summary>
Invite any member of your organization to give you some constructive feedback on your performance in a role or in a team, about your general participation and contribution, or about any other area you wish to develop.
</summary>

Before the invitation, consider who might be able and willing to provide the feedback you seek, and decide on an appropriate duration â€“ 15 or 30 minutes is usually enough.

Schedule the session in advance, so that your peer can prepare for your meeting, and schedule some time for yourself after the session to decide how you will act on the feedback you received.

In the invitation, clarify the topic you want feedback on, and explain that you are looking for both **appreciations** and **actionable improvement suggestions**.

During the session itself, consider:

-   taking notes to ensure you can remember the details
-   repeating back, feedback you receive in your own words to check for the accuracy of your understanding
-   asking clarifying question to better understand feedback if the intended meaning is unclear for you 

Avoid discussing or judging the feedback you receive and remember to thank your peer for taking the time to give you their feedback. 

After the session, review your notes and decide for yourself what you will do with the feedback you received. It's your choice if you want to share your decision with your peer.
