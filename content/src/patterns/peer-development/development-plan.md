# Development Plan

<summary>
A plan for how to develop more effective ways of accounting for a domain, agreed between delegator and delegatee.
</summary>

The development plan may be created for a person in a role, or for a team (e.g. a department, [circle](section:circle) or [open team](section:open-team)).

Development may happen in the form of refining the [description of the driver](section:describe-organizational-drivers) and the [domain](glossary:domain), making amendments to [strategy](glossary:strategy), or new or updated agreements and specific actions to be taken, either within the domain of the delegator, or the domain of the delegatee.

A development plan (and any accompanying recommendations for changes to the descriptions of the domain and the [driver](glossary:organizational-driver)) requires consent from both the [delegatee](glossary:delegatee) and the [delegator](glossary:delegator).
