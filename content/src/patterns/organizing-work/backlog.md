# Backlog

<summary>
A **backlog** (to-do-list) is a list of (often prioritized) uncompleted work items (deliverables), or (drivers) that need to be addressed.
</summary>

Consider making backlogs visible, not only to other members of a team, but also to the wider organization.

Types of backlog include:

-   [governance](glossary:governance) backlog
-   [operations](glossary:operations) backlog
-   [sprint](section:planning-and-review-meetings) backlog
-   product backlog
-   impediments backlog

**Implementation:**

-   **analog backlog:** sticky notes on a wall, or index cards, magnets and whiteboard
-   **digital backlog:** e.g. [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Kanban Flow](https://kanbanflow.com/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [Asana](https://asana.com/)

Each item on a (prioritized) backlog typically contains:

-   a **short description** of a [deliverable](glossary:deliverable) or a [driver](glossary:organizational-driver)
-   a **unique reference number** (or link) for each work item
-   (the **order of work items**)
-   **dependencies** to other work items or projects
-   **due date** (if necessary)
-   (optional) a measure for **value**
-   (optional) a measure for **investment** (often an estimate of time or complexity)
