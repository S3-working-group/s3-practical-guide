# Backlog

<summary>
Keep an up-to-date list of things you need to address, so that you can remember them, and use that information to plan and organize your work.

{{define:backlog}}

Backlogs are at the core of any reliable and transparent system for organizing work and governance. Consider making backlogs visible, not only to other members of a team but also to the wider organization.

Rather than getting side-tracked when a new work item comes up, make a note of it in the appropriate backlog, so that you keep focus on the work in progress.

Types of backlog include:

-   [governance](glossary:governance) backlog
-   [operations](glossary:operations) backlog
-   [sprint](section:planning-and-review-meetings) backlog
-   product backlog
-   impediments backlog

**Implementation:**

-   **analog backlog:** sticky notes on a wall, or index cards, magnets and whiteboard
-   **digital backlog:** e.g. [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Kanban Flow](https://kanbanflow.com/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [Asana](https://asana.com/)

Each item on a (prioritized) backlog typically contains:

-   a **short description** of the work item typically a [deliverable](glossary:deliverable) [requirement](glossary:requirement) or a [driver](glossary:organizational-driver)
-   reference to other **interdependent work items** or projects, as well as to any other relevant information
-   an **estimate of the time** required to deal with it

It can also be useful to include:
- a due date (if necessary)
- a way of visualizing rank or priorities (see [Prioritized Backlog](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/prioritize-backlogs.html))
