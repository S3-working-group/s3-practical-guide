# Record Governance Agreements

<summary>
Record the details and purpose of governance agreements you make, so that you remember what was decided over time.

While to some the idea of recording governance agreements might seem like an overhead at first, there are numerous **benefits** to being able to recollect and review what has been decided and why over time: 

-   Supports [evaluating outcomes and evolving agreements](section:evaluate-and-evolve-agreements) over time
-   Helps people understand their own and others' commitments and responsibilities
-   Provides everyone access to important information they need to contribute effectively 
-   Facilitates the effective onboarding of new members by enabling them to learn for themselves about organizational agreements that are relevant to their work
-   Supports the coherent execution of agreements within and across teams
-   Helps to ensure continuity and coherence in decision-making by providing a source of reference for future decision-making
-   Reduces the potential for differences of opinion about existing agreements, and makes any remaining disputes easier to resolve

**Note:** Even though the term governance _agreement_ suggests agreements made between two or more people, in this guide the term also refers to governance decisions made by an individual in a role.

Keep an up to date record of all governance agreements in a [logbook](glossary:logbook).


## What to record?

Record agreements with adequate detail so that important information can be recalled later.

**At the very least** include: 

-   a summary of the driver and requirement
-   a description of whatâ€™s been agreed
-   who is responsible for what
-   review date, metrics and how they will be monitored.

Depending on the scope and significance of the agreement, consider including all of the following:

-   A title for the agreement
-   Date of creation (or version)
-   Date of expiry or due date (if relevant)
-   [Description of the driver](section:describe-organizational-drivers) and [requirement](section:determine-requirments)
-   [Intended outcome](section:clarify-intended-outcome)(s)
-   A description of the agreement, including:
    -   Any relevant requirements and expectations
    -   Action items and deliverables
    -   Rationale (in the case that otherwise it would be unclear)
    -   Resources
    -   Constraints
-   [Evaluation](section:evaluate-and-evolve-agreements)
    -   Metrics and Monitoring 
    -   Review date (or frequency)
    -   Any concerns 
-   Who is responsible for what?
    -   E.g. overseeing execution of this agreement, executing specific parts of the agreement
    -   Monitoring which metrics and or acting when thresholds are not met
-   Appendix (if helpful)
    -   Background information
    -   Previous versions of the agreements
    -   References


## Recording Operational Agreements

While all governance agreements need to be recorded so that they can be remembered, reviewed and evaluated over time, sometimes it might be beneficial to record some operational agreements as well, although in most cases, far less information is required. For example: 


-   A note of who will take responsibility for a specific task, and by when
-   An appointment in a team calendar
-   A task on a taskboard
