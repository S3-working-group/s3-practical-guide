# Record Governance Decisions

<summary>
Document the purpose and details of significant decisions to ensure a clear record is maintained so that you can recall what was decided over time.
</summary>

Significant decisions (a.k.a. governance decisions) refer to setting objectives—either for the entire organization or for specific people within it— and the decisions that are made to guide people toward achieving those objectives: deciding which drivers to focus on and when, which requirements to fulfill, and deciding on the policies that are created to fulfill those requirements. 

While recording governance decisions might initially appear time-consuming, there are numerous benefits to being able to recollect and review what has been decided and why over time:

-   Facilitates evaluation of outcomes and adaptation of agreements
-   Helps people understand their own and others' commitments and responsibilities
-   Provides everyone access to important information they need to contribute effectively 
-   Facilitates the effective onboarding of new members by enabling them to learn for themselves about organizational agreements that are relevant to their work
-   Supports the coherent execution of agreements within and across teams
-   Ensures continuity and coherence in decision-making by offering a source of reference for future decisions
-   Reduces the potential for differences of opinion about existing agreements, and makes any remaining disputes easier to resolve

Whether you are making governance decisions alone or with a team, and whether those decisions affect only yourself (e.g. as an individual in a role), or others as well, it’s still worthwhile recording them.

Keep an up-to-date record of all governance decisions in a [logbook](glossary:logbook). 

For guidance on how to record drivers and requirements, see the patterns [Describe Organizational Drivers]() and [Determine Requirements]().


## Recording Policies

Record policies with adequate detail so that important information can be recalled later.

**At the very least** include: 

-   a summary of the driver and requirement
-   the intended outcome of the policy
-   a description of what’s been agreed
-   who is responsible for what
-   review date, relevant metrics, and how they will be monitored.

Depending on the scope and significance of the policy, consider including all of the following:



-   A title for the agreement
-   Date of creation (or version)
-   Date of expiry or due date (if relevant)
-   [Description of the driver](section:describe-organizational-drivers) and [requirement](glossary:requirement)
-   [Intended outcomes](section:clarify-intended-outcomes)
-   A description of the agreement, including:
    -   Any relevant requirements and expectations
    -   Action items and deliverables
    -   Rationale (in the case that otherwise it would be unclear)
    -   Resources
    -   Constraints
-   [Evaluation]()
    -   Metrics and Monitoring 
    -   Review date (or frequency)
    -   Any concerns 
-   Who is responsible for what?
    -   E.g. overseeing execution of this agreement, executing specific parts of the agreement
    -   Monitoring which metrics and or acting when thresholds are not met
-   Appendix (if helpful)
    -   Background information
    -   Previous versions of the agreements
    -   References


## Recording Operational Agreements

While all governance agreements need to be recorded so that they can be remembered, reviewed and evaluated over time, sometimes it might be beneficial to record some operational agreements as well, although in most cases, far less information is required. For example: 


-   A note of who will take responsibility for a specific task, and by when
-   An appointment in a team calendar
-   A task on a taskboard
