**Note:** In S3, guidelines, processes or protocols created by individuals in roles are also treated as agreements.

Keep records of agreements up to date, e.g. in a [logbook](glossary:logbook).


## What to record?

Record agreements with adequate detail so that important information can be recalled later.

At the very least include a summary of the driver, a description of what's been agreed, who is responsible for what, evaluation criteria and a review date.

Depending on the scope and significance of the agreement, consider including all of the following:

-   A title for the agreement
-   [Description of the driver](section:describe-organizational-drivers)
-   Date of creation (or version)
-   Date of expiry or due date (if relevant)
-   Review date (or frequency)
-   Who is responsible for what?
-   A description of the agreement, including:
    -   Any relevant requirements and expectations
    -   Action items
    -   Resources
    -   Constraints
    -   [Intended outcomes](section:clarify-intended-outcome)
    -   [Deliverables](section:describe-deliverables)
    -   Rationale
-   [Evaluation criteria](section:evaluation-criteria) (and potentially [concerns](glossary:concern))
-   Appendix (if helpful)
    -   Background information
    -   Previous versions of the agreements
    -   References
