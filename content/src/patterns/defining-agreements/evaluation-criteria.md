# Evaluation Criteria

<summary>
Develop well-defined evaluation criteria to determine if acting on an agreement had the desired effect.
</summary>

-   go for **simple and unambiguous** criteria and document them (to avoid discussion or unnecessary dialogue when reviewing your [agreements](glossary:governance-agreement))
-   define **actionable [metrics](glossary:metric)** to continuously track effects and spot deviations from [intended outcome](glossary:intended-outcome)
-   consider adding criteria which make it explicit when the outcome of an agreement would be considered **unsuccessful**
-   when reviewing an agreement, consider **evolving the evaluation criteria** based on what you have learned
