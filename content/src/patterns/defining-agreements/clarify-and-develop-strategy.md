## Clarify and Develop Strategy

<summary>

It is usually more effective if a team or role keeper lead in developing their own strategy.

A strategy often includes a description of the [intended outcome](glossary:intended-outcome) of implementing that strategy.

As the [delegator](glossary:delegator) shares accountability for [domains](glossary:domain) they delegate, it's valuable they review a [delegatee's](glossary:delegatee) strategy, to check for potential impediments and suggest ways it could be improved.

A strategy is a shared agreement between delegator(s) and delegatee(s) that is regularly reviewed and updated as necessary (*pivot or persevere*)
