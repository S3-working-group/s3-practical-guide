<summary>
Be explicit about the outcome a governance agreement or significant activity is intended to achieve, to build shared understanding among those involved and evaluate the results of your actions.
</summary>


{{define:intended-outcome}}

Be sure to explain intended outcomes in a way that allows you to [define suitable metrics and monitor results](section:define-and-monitor-metrics) to help determine whether or not they have been achieved. 

The imperatives or guidelines laid out in an agreement should be coherent with the outcomes you want to achieve. The intended outcomes should also be relevant for fulfilling the requirement and/or responding to the driver in a suitable way.

Defining and agreeing on the outcomes you intend to achieve helps build shared understanding about the purpose of an agreement or activity, avoid misconceptions, ensure coherent execution of agreements, and evaluate the results of your actions. 

In many cases it is helpful to describe intended outcomes using the formulation: X, so that Y.


## Examples

_See [Define and Monitor Metrics](section:define-and-monitor-metrics) for examples of metrics derived from the intended outcomes shown below._

**Example 1:**

**Driver**: _We spend 25% of our work hours on admin work and this is leading to slow response time for customer requests and a growing number of complaints. We’re starting to develop a bad reputation and run the risk of losing customers and compromising future sales._

**Requirement:** _We need to free up time for handling customer requirements in a timely manner, so that we improve customer satisfaction and eliminate this type of complaint_

**Agreement**: _Hire a specialist to handle some of the administrative work._

**Intended outcome:** ***People working on the product will spend less time on administrative work, allowing them to focus more on the customer.***

**Example 2:**

**Driver**: _Information is unstructured, kept in silos and sometimes unrecorded, leading to people working with missing or outdated information, which results in ineffectiveness and our clients’ needs being unmet._

**Requirement**: _We need to store and share relevant information effectively, to improve everyone’s ability to provide valuable solutions for our customers._

**Agreement:** ***Schedule a meeting with representatives from the impacted domains to create an overview of the information each team has available, where it is stored, and what information the different teams need. Determine the next steps after that.***

**Intended outcomes:**

-   ***We have an overview of all the required information so that we can co-create a suitable structure for storing it.***
-   ***he (above) overview enables teams to more easily find the information that is already available.***
-   ***We know what information is missing so that we can make a plan for how to provide it.***
