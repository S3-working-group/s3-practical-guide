## Coordinator

A person fulfilling the role of a coordinator is accountable for **coordinating a domain's operations** and is **selected for a limited term.**

The coordinator may be selected by the team itself, or by the [delegator](glossary:delegator).

Several coordinators may collaborate to synchronize work across multiple [domains](glossary:domain).

Instead of selecting a coordinator, a team may choose to self-organize.
