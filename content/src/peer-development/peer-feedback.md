## Peer Feedback

Invite a peer to give you some constructive feedback on: 

-   your performance in a role
-   your general participation and contribution
-   any specific aspect you may be interested in

Considerations:

-   invite peers to take some time to prepare
-   invite both **appreciations** and **actionable improvement suggestions**
-   inquire to better understand the feedback, and avoid to discuss or judge it
-   decide for yourself what you will do with feedback you receive
