## Double-Linked Hierarchy

**Delegate all decision making to self-governing circles, double-linked across all levels of the hierarchy, to transition from an traditional hierarchy towards a structure more suitable for tapping collective intelligence and building engagement.**

1. Shift governance decision making from individuals to teams by forming [self-governing](glossary:self-governance) [circles](glossary:circle) on all levels of your organization.

2. Each circle's members select one of their group to represent their interests and participate in the [governance](glossary:governance) decision making of the next higher circle, and vice versa.

A double-linked hierarchy:

- brings equivalence to governance
- maintains the potential for a functional hierarchy (if it enables the flow of value).
