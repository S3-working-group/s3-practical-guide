# Double-Linked Hierarchy

<summary>
Delegate all authority for making governance decisions to self-governing circles, double-linked across all levels of the hierarchy, to transition from an traditional hierarchy towards a structure more suitable for tapping collective intelligence, ensuring equivalence and building engagement.
</summary>

1. Shift governance decision-making from individuals to teams by forming [self-governing](glossary:governance) [circles](glossary:circle) on all levels of your organization.
2. Each circle's members select one of their group to represent their interests and participate in the [governance](glossary:governance) decision-making of the next higher circle, and vice versa.

A double-linked hierarchy:

- brings equivalence to governance
- maintains the potential for a functional hierarchy (if it enables the flow of value).
