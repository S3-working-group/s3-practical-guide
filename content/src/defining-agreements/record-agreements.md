## Record Agreements

**Record the details of agreements you make, so you can recall them later, evaluate the outcome and evolve the agreement over time.**

{{define:agreement}}

**Note:** In S3, guidelines, processes or protocols created by individuals in roles are also treated as agreements.

Keep records of agreements up to date, e.g. in a [logbook](glossary:logbook).


### What to record?

Record agreements with adequate detail so that important information can be recalled later. 

At the very least include a summary of the driver, a description of what’s been agreed, who is responsible for what, evaluation criteria and a review date.

Depending on the scope and significance of the agreement, consider including all of the following:

-   A title for the agreement
-   [Description of the driver](section:describe-organizational-drivers)
-   Date of creation (and/or version)
-   Date of expiry or due date (if relevant)
-   Review date (or frequency)
-   Who is responsible for what?
-   A description of the agreement, including:
    - Any relevant requirements and expectations
    - Action items
    - Resources
    - Constraints
    - [Intended outcomes](section:clarify-intended-outcome)
    - [Deliverables](section:describe-deliverables)
    - Rationale
-   [Evaluation criteria](section:evaluation-criteria) (and potentially [concerns](glossary:concern))
-   Appendix (if helpful)
    - Background information
    - Previous versions of the agreements
    - References
