# A Practical Guide for Evolving Agile and Resilient Organizations with Sociocracy 3.0

This repository contains the source files for the book _A Practical Guide for Evolving Agile and Resilient Organizations with Sociocracy 3.0_, currently available as 

* fast and mobile-friendly static html pages: <http://patterns.sociocracy30.org>
* ePub and PDF

German, Hebrew and French versions also exist and are also available via [sociocracy30.org/guide/](http://sociocracy30.org/guide/). If you want to help with translations into your language, please take a look at the [translations page](http://sociocracy30.org/translations/).

## Project Structure

- `content`: all the files that are uploaded to Crowdin for translation (or downloaded from crowdin to the translated repositories)
- `global`: files that are identical across languages, mostly templates, including some with translatable content that is collected in content/translations.pot, because Crowdin does not play nice with these files. Also contains not language-specific configuration file
- `config`: language-specific configuration files: project.yaml, make-conf, LaTEX styles etc
- `release`: the latest releasable builds (must be copied there manually, all build scripts deliver their output to the project root)
- `tmp` the Temporary folder is autogenerated by  `build.sh` or with `make setup`


## Build Process

`build.sh` builds all available targets, you can also use `make <target>` to build individual target.

The build process relies on [mdtools](https://github.com/bboc/mdtools) to prepare and compile the individual files, and on Pandoc for ePub and LaTEX for PDF.

Before the first target can be built, you need to run `make setup`, and the before building the static site adding or removing source files or illustrations it's a good idea to run `make clean`.

To set up a new language, run `make clean` and then copy over `content`, `global`, `config` and all files in the project root except for `crowdin.yaml` and `upload-translations.sh`. Adapt `build.sh` so it only contains targets that are available in that language (e.g. deckset makes no sense for RTL languages).

## Known Issues

The ePub will benefit from polishing the stylesheet and setting some [metadata for iBooks](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#epub-metadata).
 
## Markdown Styleguide

Information in this section is preliminary, and needs further testing.

The Markdown files for the individual patterns are grouped in directories per patterns group and built using a build script. 

The following rules apply:

* MMd-transclusion  via {{filename}} is possible for all templates rendered via MMD 
* Markdown must conform to GitHub-flavored Markdown so that the Jekyll-version is feature complete 


## Translations

The content is translated in a [dedicated crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/sociocracy-30). The repository contains `crowdin.yaml` for use with the [crowdin CLI](https://support.crowdin.com/cli-tool/). 

Uploading sources is handled through this command (remove `--dryrun` to run):

`crowdin --identity ~/crowdin-s3-patterns.yaml --dryrun upload sources`

For each major revision we will create a branch with the version tag in crowdin, so future updates do not disrupt translation efforts:

`crowdin --identity ~/crowdin-s3-patterns.yaml upload sources -b {branch name} --dryrun`

The config file can be checked using 
`crowdin --identity ~/crowdin-s3-patterns.yaml lint`

 These commands assume [crowdin credentials](https://support.crowdin.com/configuration-file/#cli-2) in `~/crowdin-s3-patterns.yaml`
