# Sociocracy 3.0 - A Practical Guide

This repository contains the source file for  a slide deck for teaching Sociocracy 3.0, currently available as:

* fast and mobile friendly static html pages: <http://patterns.sociocracy30.org>
* [online presentation](http://patterns.sociocracy30.org/slides.html)
* various other download formats, see  [sociocracy30.org/guide/](http://sociocracy30.org/guide/)

German, Hebrew and French versions also exist and are also available via [sociocracy30.org/guide/](http://sociocracy30.org/guide/). If you want to help with translations into your language, please take a look at the [translations page](http://sociocracy30.org/translations/).

## Project Structure

- `content`: all the files that are uploaded to Crowdin for translation (or downloaded from crowdin to the translated repositories)
- `global`: files that are identical across languages, mostly templates, including some with translatable content that is collected in content/translations.pot, because Crowdin does not play nice with these files. Also contains not language-specific configuration file
- `config`: language-specific configuration files: project.yaml, make-conf, LaTEX styles etc
- `release`: the latest releasable builds (must be copied there manually, all build scripts deliver their output to the project root)
- `tmp` the Temporary folder is autogenerated by  `build.sh` or with `make setup`


## Build Process

`build.sh` builds all available targets, you can also use `make <target>` to build individual target.

The build process relies on [mdtools](https://github.com/bboc/mdtools) to prepare and compile the individual files, and on pandoc and LaTEX for epub formats.

Before the first target can be built, you need to run `make setup`, and the before building the static site adding or removing source files or illustrations it's a good idea to run `make clean`.

To set up a new language, run `make clean` and then copy over `content`, `global`, `config` and all files in the project root except for `crowdin.yaml` and `upload-translations.sh`. Adapt `build.sh` so it only contains targets that are available in that language (e.g. deckset makes no sense for RTL languages).

## Formats and Known Issues

The main format for the practical guide is a Jekyll website on <https://patterns.sociocracy30.org>.

Downloads are currently available as PDF or PNG slides exported from [Deckset](decksetapp.com), as a html-version in [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) a static website (using jekyll and GitHub pages), and as e-books (ePub and PDF).

Deckset is nice to quickly hack together a beautiful presentation, but is a bit lacking when it comes to navigating larger presentations, and it's only available as a macOS app. Building the Hebrew version I discovered the hard way it does not support RTL languages., and did not find a way to automate pdf export, so with a growing number of languages Deckset is becoming increasingly painful.

This is why I was looking at more open formats, and developed a generator for reveal.js, which generally works, but there might still a few small glitches in the CSS. Ping me if you find one. You can see it in action at <https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/slides.html>

[Reveal.js docs](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/README.md)

Exporting to epub (via pandoc) and pdf via LaTEX is working, but still rough around the edges. The epub will benefit from a stylesheet and setting some [metadata for ibooks](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#epub-metadata), while the styles for the pdf need some cleanup in all but the German versions.

## Markdown Styleguide

Information in this section is preliminary, and needs further testing.

The Markdown files for the individual patterns are grouped in directories per patterns group and built using a build script. Input format is Deckset 1 (for now), i.e. slide separators are "---". This will hopefully change in the future.

* Images always float right (because that works without clearing the float in reveal.js), and are set to height of 100%. Floating images go BEFORE the text, and are marked "right,fit"
* single images on slides: [inline,fit]
* Headline Level 1 is always the only content on the slide (apart from background images)
* Headline level 2  or more is increased by one for reveal.js
* within each pattern, the pattern title is headline level 2, all slides in patterns with a dedicated title need to use headline level 3, so it does not show up in the TOC on the website

## Updating reveal.js

Download zip from the [official repo](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) and copy files over to `docs/reveal.js`. Diff `templates/revealjs-template.html` with `demo.html` to see if there are some changes to the basic html structure.

Keep (or adapt) `custom-styles.css` and `custom-theme.css` (derived from `css/theme/white.css`.

## Translations

Slides are translated in a [dedicated crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/sociocracy-30). The repository contains `crowdin.yaml` for use with the [crowdin CLI](https://support.crowdin.com/cli-tool/).

Uploading sources is handled through this command (remove `--dryrun` to run):

`crowdin --identity ~/crowdin-s3-patterns.yaml --dryrun upload sources`

For each major revision we will create a branch with the version tag in crowdin, so future updates do not disrupt translation efforts:

`crowdin --identity ~/crowdin-s3-patterns.yaml upload sources -b {branch name} --dryrun`

The config file can be checked using
`crowdin --identity ~/crowdin-s3-patterns.yaml lint`

 These commands assume [crowdin credentials](https://support.crowdin.com/configuration-file/#cli-2) in `~/crowdin-s3-patterns.yaml`
