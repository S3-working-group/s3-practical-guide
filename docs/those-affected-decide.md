title: "Those Affected Decide"
---


Involve everyone who will be affected by a decision, to maintain equivalence and accountability, and increase the amount of information available on the subject.

For larger groups:

-   facilitate a process in several stages and create smaller groups who select delegates
-   set out a virtual, asynchronous, time-boxed and staged process

Consider including those affected also in review and evolution of decisions.
