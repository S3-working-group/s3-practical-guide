title: "Backlog"

_A **backlog** (to-do-list) is a list of (often prioritized) uncompleted work items (deliverables), or (drivers) that need to be addressed._

Consider making backlogs visible, not only to other members of a team, but also to the wider organization.

Types of backlog include:

-   <dfn data-info="Governance: The act of setting objectives, and then navigating and steering to achieve them. People with authority intentionally make and evolve decisions which have an ongoing effect on the way an organization (or a team or individual within it) creates value. These decisions set constraints on actions, guide future decisions, allocate resources and determine specifics of deliverables.">governance</dfn> backlog
-   <dfn data-info="Operations: Doing the work and organizing day to day activities within the constraints defined through governance.">operations</dfn> backlog
-   [sprint](planning-and-review-meetings.html) backlog
-   product backlog
-   impediments backlog

**Implementation:**

-   **analog backlog**: sticky notes on a wall, or index cards, magnets and whiteboard
-   **digital backlog**: e.g. [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Kanban Flow](https://kanbanflow.com/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [Asana](https://asana.com/)

Each item on a (prioritized) backlog typically contains:

-   a **short description** of a <dfn data-info="Deliverable: A product, service, component or material provided in response to an organizational driver.">deliverable</dfn> or a <dfn data-info="Organizational Driver: A driver is a person’s or a group&apos;s motive for responding to a specific situation. A driver is considered an **organizational driver** if responding to it would help the organization generate value, eliminate waste or avoid harm.">driver</dfn>
-   a **unique reference number** (or link) for each work item
-   (the **order of work items**)
-   **dependencies** to other work items or projects
-   **due date** (if necessary)
-   (optional) a measure for **value** 
-   (optional) a measure for **investment** (often an estimate of time or complexity)
