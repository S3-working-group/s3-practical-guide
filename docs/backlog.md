<div class="card summary"><div class="card-body">A <strong>backlog</strong> (to-do-list) is a list of (often prioritized) uncompleted work items (deliverables), or (drivers) that need to be addressed.
</div></div>

Consider making backlogs visible, not only to other members of a team, but also to the wider organization.

Types of backlog include:

-   <a href="glossary.html#entry-governance" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Governance: The process of setting objectives and making and evolving decisions that guide people towards achieving those objectives.">governance</a> backlog
-   <a href="glossary.html#entry-operations" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Operations: Doing the work and organizing day-to-day activities within the constraints defined through governance.">operations</a> backlog
-   [sprint](planning-and-review-meetings.html) backlog
-   product backlog
-   impediments backlog

**Implementation:**

-   **analog backlog:** sticky notes on a wall, or index cards, magnets and whiteboard
-   **digital backlog:** e.g. [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Kanban Flow](https://kanbanflow.com/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [Asana](https://asana.com/)

Each item on a (prioritized) backlog typically contains:

-   a **short description** of a <a href="glossary.html#entry-deliverable" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Deliverable: A product, service, component or material provided to fulfill a requirement.">deliverable</a> or a <a href="glossary.html#entry-organizational-driver" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Organizational Driver: Any situation where the organization&#x27;s members have a motive to respond because they anticipate that doing so would be beneficial for the organization (by helping to generate value, eliminate waste or avoid undesirable risks or consequences).">driver</a>
-   a **unique reference number** (or link) for each work item
-   (the **order of work items**)
-   **dependencies** to other work items or projects
-   **due date** (if necessary)
-   (optional) a measure for **value**
-   (optional) a measure for **investment** (often an estimate of time or complexity)
