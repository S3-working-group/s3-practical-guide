_A **backlog** (to-do list) is a list of (often prioritized) uncompleted work items (typically a deliverable, requirement or a driver) that need to be addressed._

Backlogs are at the core of any reliable and transparent system for organizing work and governance. Consider making backlogs visible, not only to other members of a team but also to the wider organization.

Rather than getting side-tracked when a new work item comes up, make a note of it in the appropriate backlog, so that you keep focus on the work in progress.

Types of backlog include:

-   <a href="glossary.html#entry-governance" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Governance: The process of setting objectives and making and evolving decisions that guide people toward achieving those objectives.">governance</a> backlog
-   <a href="glossary.html#entry-operations" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Operations: Doing the work and organizing day-to-day activities within the constraints defined through governance.">operations</a> backlog
-   [sprint](planning-and-review-meetings.html) backlog
-   product backlog
-   impediments backlog

**Implementation:**

-   **analog backlog:** sticky notes on a wall, or index cards, magnets and whiteboard
-   **digital backlog:** e.g. [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Kanban Flow](https://kanbanflow.com/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [Asana](https://asana.com/)

Each item on a (prioritized) backlog typically contains:

-   a **short description** of the work item (typically a <a href="glossary.html#entry-deliverable" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Deliverable: A product, service, component or material provided to fulfill a requirement.">deliverable</a> <a href="glossary.html#entry-requirement" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Requirement: A need or desire considered necessary to fulfill to respond to an organizational driver, adequately or as a suitable incremental next step.">requirement</a> or a <a href="glossary.html#entry-organizational-driver" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Organizational Driver: Any situation where the organization&#x27;s members have a motive to respond because they anticipate that doing so would be beneficial for the organization (by helping to generate value, eliminate waste or avoid undesirable risks or consequences).">driver</a>)
-   reference to other **interdependent work items** or projects, as well as to any **other relevant information**
-   an **estimate of the time** required to deal with it

It can also be useful to include:
- a due date (if necessary)
- a way of visualizing rank or priorities (see [Prioritized Backlog](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/prioritize-backlogs.html))
