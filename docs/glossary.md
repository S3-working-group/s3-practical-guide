**Organization:** A group of people collaborating toward a shared driver (or objective). Often an organization subdivides into several teams.

**Organizational Driver:** A driver is a person’s or a group's motive for responding to a specific situation. A driver is considered an **organizational driver** if responding to it would help the organization generate value, eliminate waste or avoid harm.

**Superdomain:** A domain that fully contains another domain.
