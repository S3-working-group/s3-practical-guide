**Circle**: A self-governing and semi-autonomous team of equivalent people who collaborate to account for a domain.

**Complexity**: An environment where unknowns are unknown, cause and effect can only be understood in retrospect, and actions lead to unpredictable changes. [Snowden and Boone]

**Consent (principle)**: Raise, seek out and resolve objections to decisions and actions.

**Constituent**: A team (e.g. a circle, team, department, branch, project or organization) who delegate authority to a representative to act on their behalf in other team or organizations.

**Continuous Improvement (principle)**: Change incrementally to accommodate steady empirical learning.

**Coordination**: The process of enabling individuals or teams to collaborate effectively across different domains to achieve shared objectives.

**Delegatee**: An individual or group accepting accountability for a domain delegated to them.

**Delegation**: The grant of authority by one party (the delegator) to another (the delegatee) to account for a domain, (i.e. to do certain things and/or to make certain decisions) for which the delegator maintains overall accountability.

**Helping Team**: A team of equivalent people with the mandate to execute on a specific set of requirements.

**Intended Outcome**: The expected result of an agreement, action, project or strategy.

**Key responsibilities**: Essential work and decision making required in the context of a domain.

**Logbook**: A (digital) system to store all information relevant for running an organization.

**Need**: The lack of something wanted or deemed necessary (a requirement).

**Open Domain**: A domain that is accounted for by a set of people who are invited to contribute when they can.

**Operations**: Doing the work and organizing day to day activities within the constraints defined through governance.

**Operations Backlog**: A visible list of (typically prioritized) uncompleted work items (deliverables).

**Organization**: A group of people collaborating toward a shared driver (or objective).

**Organizational Driver**: A driver is a person’s or a group's motive for responding to a specific situation. A driver is considered an **organizational driver** if responding to it would help the organization generate value, eliminate waste or avoid harm.

**Pattern**: A template for successfully navigating a specific context.

**Peer Domain**: Two peer domains are contained within the same immediate superdomain, and may be overlapping.

**Role**: A domain that is delegated to an individual.

**Self-Governance**: People governing themselves within the constraints of a domain.

**Self-Organization**: Any activity or process through which people organize their day-to-day work without the influence of an external agent, and within constraints defined through governance. In any organization or team, self-organization and external influence co-exist.

**Semi-Autonomy**: The autonomy of people to create value within their domain, further limited by their own governance decisions, and objections (including those of the delegator and of representatives).

**Sociocracy**: A mindset where people affected by decisions can influence them on the basis of reasons to do so.

**Sociocratic Circle-Organisation Method (SCM)**: An egalitarian governance method for organizations based on a sociocratic mindset, developed in the Netherlands by Gerard Endenburg.

**Strategy**: A high level approach for how people will create value to successfully account for a domain.

**Subdomain**: A domain that is fully contained within another domain.

**Superdomain**: A domain that fully contains another domain.
