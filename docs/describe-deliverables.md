title: "Describe Deliverables"
---


A **deliverable** is something which is provided as a result of an agreement in response to a driver. Deliverables include products, raw materials, services, experiences and transformations.

In the context of an agreement, clearly describing deliverables supports shared understanding:

-   include the necessary amount of detail
-   reference other documents when helpful or necessary



Explicitly defining deliverables can be useful for improving: 

-   organizational strategy
-   circle strategy
-   development plans
-   domain descriptions
-   any other agreement (e.g. business goals, process policy, customer communication)
