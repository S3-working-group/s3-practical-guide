title: "Open Domain"

**Intentionally account for a domain by invitation rather than assignment and request that those invited contribute when they can.**

The <dfn data-info="Delegator: An individual or group delegating a domain to other(s) to be accountable for.">delegator</dfn> of the open domain clarifies:
 
- the <dfn data-info="Primary Driver: The primary driver for a domain is the main driver that people who account for that domain respond to.">primary driver</dfn>, key responsibilities and constraints of the open domain
- who is invited to contribute to the open domain
- constraints relating to the delegator’s participation in the open domain’s <dfn data-info="Governance: The act of setting objectives, and making and evolving decisions that guide people towards achieving them.">governance</dfn>

Depending on the constraints set by the delegator, contributors may only <dfn data-info="Operations: Doing the work and organizing day to day activities within the constraints defined through governance.">organize and do work</dfn>, or take part in governance as well.

A delegator is accountable for conducting regular reviews to support effectiveness of work and any decision making done in an open domain.
