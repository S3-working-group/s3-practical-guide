A circle:

-   may be permanent or temporary
-   may be <a href="glossary.html#entry-self-organization" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Self-Organization: Any activity or process through which people organize work. Self-organization happens within the constraints of a domain, but without the direct influence of  external agents. In any organization or team, self-organization co-exists with external influence (e.g. external objections or governance decisions that affect the domain).">self-organizing</a>
-   is responsible for its own development and its body of <a href="glossary.html#entry-agreement" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Agreement: An agreed-upon guideline, process, protocol or policy designed to guide the flow of value.">agreements</a>

-   **semi-autonomous:**

    -   Each circle can create <a href="glossary.html#entry-value" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Value: The importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to a driver. Also &quot;a valued principle that guides behavior&quot; (mostly used as plural, &quot;values&quot;, or &quot;organizational values&quot;).">value</a> autonomously.
-   **self-governing:**
    -   A circle's members continuously decide together what to do to account for their domain, and set constraints on how and when things will be done.
-  **equivalence of circle members:**
    -   All members of a circle are equally accountable for <a href="glossary.html#entry-governance" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Governance: The process of setting objectives and making and evolving decisions that guide people toward achieving those objectives.">governance</a> of the circle's domain.
