    -   All members of a circle are equally accountable for <dfn data-info="Governance: The act of setting objectives, and then navigating and steering to achieve them. People with authority intentionally make and evolve decisions which have an ongoing effect on the way an organization (or a team or individual within it) creates value. These decisions set constraints on actions, guide future decisions, allocate resources and determine specifics of deliverables.">governance</dfn> of the circle's domain.
