<div class="card summary"><div class="card-body">Limit the number of work items in any stage of your work process.
</div></div>

Work in progress includes:

-   the number of items in a <a href="glossary.html#entry-backlog" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Backlog: A list of (often prioritized) uncompleted work items (typically a deliverable, requirement or a driver) that need to be addressed.">backlog</a>
-   concurrent projects or tasks for teams or individuals
-   products in a portfolio

When an action would exceed an agreed upon limit of work items in progress, this needs to be brought up with the team before continuing.
