-   Where are my interactions with others unhelpful or ineffective?
-   Which agreements do I find hard to keep? What can I do to address this?
-   What skills can I develop, that would support me to participate more artfully?
-   What would artful participation mean in relation to:
    -   my daily activities?
    -   collaboration and interaction with others?
    -   the organization? ...our customers or clients?
    -   the wider environment?
