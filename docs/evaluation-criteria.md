title: "Evaluation Criteria"
---


**Develop well-defined evaluation criteria to determine if acting on an agreement had the desired effect.**

-   go for **simple and unambiguous** criteria and document them (to avoid discussion or unnecessary dialogue when reviewing your <dfn data-info="Agreement: An agreed upon guideline, process or protocol designed to guide the flow of value.">agreements</dfn>)
-   define **actionable metrics** to continuously track effects and spot deviations from <dfn data-info="Intended Outcome: The expected result of an agreement, action, project or strategy.">intended outcome</dfn>
-   consider adding criteria which make it explicit when the outcome of an agreement would be considered **unsuccessful**
-   when reviewing an agreement, consider **evolving the evaluation criteria** based on what you have learned
