<div class="card summary"><div class="card-body">Develop well-defined evaluation criteria to determine if acting on an agreement had the desired effect.
</div></div>

-   go for **simple and unambiguous** criteria and document them (to avoid discussion or unnecessary dialogue when reviewing your <a href="glossary.html#entry-agreement" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Agreement: An agreed-upon guideline, process, protocol or policy designed to guide the flow of value.">agreements</a>)
-   define **actionable <a href="glossary.html#entry-metric" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Metric: A quantifiable measure used to track and assess progress, evaluate outcomes and determine success">metrics</a>** to continuously track effects and spot deviations from <a href="glossary.html#entry-intended-outcome" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Intended Outcome: The expected result of an agreement, action, project or strategy.">intended outcome</a>
-   consider adding criteria which make it explicit when the outcome of an agreement would be considered **unsuccessful**
-   when reviewing an agreement, consider **evolving the evaluation criteria** based on what you have learned
