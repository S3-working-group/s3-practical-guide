title: "Continuous Improvement Of Work Process With S3"
---


**To reveal drivers and establish a metrics-based pull-system for organizational change.**

-   introduce the principle of consent and _Navigate Via Tension_ to evolve work process in one team
-   consider selecting a facilitator and agreeing on values
-   trigger continuous improvement (e.g through Kanban)
-   team members pull in S3 patterns as required
-   expand the scope of the experiment iteratively
-   intentionally look out for impediments  


### Waste And Continuous Improvement

![right,fit](img/workflow-and-value/drivers-value-waste.png)

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response to a driver._

-   waste exists in various forms and on different levels of abstraction (tasks, processes, organizational structure, mental models...)
-   establishing a process for ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness
-   adaptation to changing context is built into the process
