**Reveal drivers and establish a metrics-based pull-system for organizational change through continuously improving and refining the work process.**

-   introduce the principle of consent and [Navigate Via Tension](navigate-via-tension.html) to evolve work process in a team
-   consider selecting a facilitator to guide group processes, and choosing values to guide behavior
-   initiate a process of continuous improvement, e.g. through Kanban or regular [retrospectives](retrospective.html)

-   intentionally look out for impediments

### Waste And Continuous Improvement

_**Waste** is anything unnecessary for — or standing in the way of — a (more) effective response of a driver._

Establishing a process for the ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness and adaptation to changing context.
