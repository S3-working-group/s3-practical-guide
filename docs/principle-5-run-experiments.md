**_Run experiments to address complex challenges, so that you learn how to move closer to where you want to be._**

Essential patterns to help you achieve this:

-   [Describe Organizational Drivers](describe-organizational-drivers.html) – Building a shared mental model of the situation you want to address is essential for successfully designing, running, and later on evaluating experiments.
-   [Determine Requirements](determine-requirements.html) - CClarifying the requirement, including the anticipated impact of fulfilling that requirement, is a prerequisite for designing the experiment, and for determining metrics for success.
-   [Clarify Intended Outcome](clarify-intended-outcome.html) – A clear description of the intended outcome of an experiment is essential for understanding whether or not an experiment produced the intended result.
-   [Evaluation Criteria](evaluation-criteria.html) – Defining clear criteria for determining success before the start of an experiment, helps to reveal flaws in its design and supports effective evaluation of outcomes. 
-   [Consent Decision-Making](consent-decision-making.html) – An effective group process for viewing a proposition from a diversity of perspectives, and for testing whether or not an experiment is good enough and safe enough to run.
-   [Evaluate and Evolve Agreements](evaluate-and-evolve-agreements.html) – An experiment needs to be regularly reviewed to determine what outcomes it achieves, and, as a consequence, potentially adapted, or even stopped.
-   [Limit Work in Progress](limit-work-in-progress.html) – Limit the number of concurrent experiments to avoid overwhelm and maintain a steady flow of value. 
-   [Create A Pull-System for Organizational Change](create-a-pull-system-for-organizational-change.html) – Inviting and enabling people to run experiments when they discover organizational requirements supports an effective and decentralized approach to organizational development.
