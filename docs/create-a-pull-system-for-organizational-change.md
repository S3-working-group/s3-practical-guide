<div class="card summary"><div class="card-body">Create an environment that invites and enables members of the organization to drive change.
</div></div>

Change things when there is value in doing so:

-   Bring in patterns that help to solve current and important problems.
-   Don't break what's already working!
-   Meet everyone where they are …
-   … and support everyone to make necessary changes at a manageable pace.
