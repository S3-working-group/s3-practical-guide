title: "Create a Pull-System For Organizational Change"
---


**Create an environment that invites and enables members of the organization to drive change.**

Change things when there is value in doing so:

-   bring in patterns that solve current and important problems
  * don't break what's already working!
  * meet everyone where they are…
  * …and let them choose their own pace
-   consider making all change voluntary!
