title: "Contracting And Accountability"
---


When entering into formal or informal agreements with others:

-   ensure all parties understand what's expected of them and intend to keep to the agreement
-   verify the agreement is beneficial to all parties, and that expectations are realistic

Be accountable for breaking agreements.

To preserve organizational culture, maintain self-accountability and help new members of an organization or circle have a smooth start:

- define expectations for new members (both cultural fit and the skills required)
- align contract with both organizational culture and legal requirements
- consider a probationary period
- have clear procedures for breaches of contract
