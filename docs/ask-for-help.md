title: "Ask For Help"
---


**A simple protocol for learning, skill sharing, and building connections, with respect for people's autonomy.**

Ask someone, "_would you be willing to help me with ..._?"  The person asked answers with a simple "_yes_" or "_no_".

-   if the request is declined, the person asking accepts the answer without negotiation or inquiry
-   if the request is unclear, inquire for more information
-   if you accept a request for help, support your peer in the best way you can
