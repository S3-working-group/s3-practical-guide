**Principle 2 – Develop Strategy:** _Develop a strategy to guide value creation, so that everyone shares a common direction, and strategy is adapted as necessary to achieve the purpose._

**Principle 3 – Focus on Value:** _Focus your daily work on value delivery, so that the stuff that needs doing to achieve your purpose is done._

**Principle 4 – Sense & Respond:** _Identify, prioritize and respond to impediments and opportunities, so that you can adapt or pivot as necessary and improve where you can._

**Principle 5 – Run Experiments:** _Run experiments to address complex challenges, so that you learn how to move closer to where you want to be._
