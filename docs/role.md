**Delegate responsibility for a domain to individuals.**

A role is an area of responsibility (a <dfn data-info="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization.">domain</dfn>) that is <dfn data-info="Delegation: The grant of authority by one party (the delegator) to another (the delegatee) to account for a domain (i.e. to do certain things and/or to make certain decisions), for which the delegator maintains overall accountability.">delegated</dfn> to an individual (the **role keeper**), who has autonomy to decide and act within the constraints of the role's domain.

The role keeper leads in creating a <dfn data-info="Strategy: A high level approach for how people will create value to successfully account for a domain.">strategy</dfn> for how they will account for their domain. They evolve their strategy in collaboration with the <dfn data-info="Delegator: An individual or group delegating responsibility for a domain to other(s).">delegator</dfn>.

A role is a simple way for an organization (or <dfn data-info="Team: A group of people collaborating toward a shared driver (or objective). Typically a team is part of an organization, or it is formed as a collaboration of several organizations.">team</dfn>) to delegate recurring tasks or a specific area of work and decision making to one of its members.

- people can take responsibility for more than one role
- instead of formally setting up a new team, it's sometimes simpler to just share one role between several people
- role keepers are selected by consent and for a limited term
- peers support one another to develop in the roles they keep

A role keeper may maintain a governance <dfn data-info="Backlog: A list of (often prioritized) uncompleted work items (deliverables), or drivers that need to be addressed.">backlog</dfn>, and a <dfn data-info="Logbook: A (digital) system to store all information relevant for running an organization.">logbook</dfn> to record and help them evolve their approach toward delivering <dfn data-info="Value: The importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to a driver. Also &quot;a principle of some significance that guides behavior&quot; (mostly used as plural, &quot;values&quot;, or &quot;organizational values&quot;).">value</dfn>.

**Note:** In S3, guidelines, processes or protocols created by individuals in roles are treated as agreements.
