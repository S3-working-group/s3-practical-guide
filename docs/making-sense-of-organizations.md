In this section you'll learn about the following key concepts:

- Driver and Requirement
- Domain
- Agreement
- Objection
- Governance and Operations

You will also discover how these concepts relate to value (and waste), delegation (and accountability), self-organization, self-governance and semi-autonomy.

When people understand these concepts, it gives them a common language for describing clearly what's going on in the organization. This helps to increase shared understanding and enables constructive dialogue about what needs to be done.

For any terms you don't understand, check out the glossary at the end.
