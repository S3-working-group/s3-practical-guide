<div class="card summary"><div class="card-body">A plan for how to develop more effective ways of accounting for a domain, agreed between delegator and delegatee.
</div></div>

The development plan may be created for a person in a role, or for a team (e.g. a department, [circle](circle.html) or [open team](open-team.html)).

Development may happen in the form of refining the [description of the driver](describe-organizational-drivers.html) and the <a href="glossary.html#entry-domain" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Domain: A distinct area of responsibility and authority within an organization.">domain</a>, making amendments to <a href="glossary.html#entry-strategy" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Strategy: A high level approach for how people will create value to successfully account for a domain.">strategy</a>, or new or updated agreements and specific actions to be taken, either within the domain of the delegator, or the domain of the delegatee.

A development plan (and any accompanying recommendations for changes to the descriptions of the domain and the <a href="glossary.html#entry-organizational-driver" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Organizational Driver: Any situation where the organization&#x27;s members have a motive to respond because they anticipate that doing so would be beneficial for the organization (by helping to generate value, eliminate waste or avoid undesirable risks or consequences).">driver</a>) requires consent from both the <a href="glossary.html#entry-delegatee" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Delegatee: An individual or group accepting responsibility for a domain delegated to them, becoming a role keeper or a team.">delegatee</a> and the <a href="glossary.html#entry-delegator" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Delegator: An individual or group delegating responsibility for a domain to other(s).">delegator</a>.
