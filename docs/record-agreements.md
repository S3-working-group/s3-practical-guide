_An **agreement** is an agreed upon guideline, process, protocol or policy designed to guide the flow of value._

**Note:** In S3, guidelines, processes or protocols created by individuals in roles are also treated as agreements.

Keep records of agreements up to date, e.g. in a <a href="glossary.html#entry-logbook" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Logbook: A (digital) system to store all information relevant for running an organization.">logbook</a>.


## What to record?

Record agreements with adequate detail so that important information can be recalled later.

At the very least include a summary of the driver, a description of what's been agreed, who is responsible for what, evaluation criteria and a review date.

Depending on the scope and significance of the agreement, consider including all of the following:

-   A title for the agreement
-   [Description of the driver](describe-organizational-drivers.html)
-   Date of creation (or version)
-   Date of expiry or due date (if relevant)
-   Review date (or frequency)
-   Who is responsible for what?
-   A description of the agreement, including:
    -   Any relevant requirements and expectations
    -   Action items
    -   Resources
    -   Constraints
    -   [Intended outcomes](clarify-intended-outcome.html)
    -   [Deliverables](describe-deliverables.html)
    -   Rationale
-   [Evaluation criteria](evaluation-criteria.html) (and potentially <a href="glossary.html#entry-concern" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Concern: An assumption that cannot (for now at least) be backed up by reasoning or enough evidence to qualify as an objection to those who are considering it.">concerns</a>)
-   Appendix (if helpful)
    -   Background information
    -   Previous versions of the agreements
    -   References
