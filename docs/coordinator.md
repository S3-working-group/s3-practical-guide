<div class="card summary"><div class="card-body">A person fulfilling the role of a coordinator is accountable for **coordinating a domain's operations** and is **selected for a limited term.
</div></div>
The coordinator may be selected by the team itself, or by the <a href="glossary.html#entry-delegator" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Delegator: An individual or group delegating responsibility for a domain to other(s).">delegator</a>.

Several coordinators may collaborate to synchronize work across multiple <a href="glossary.html#entry-domain" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision-making within an organization.">domains</a>.
