title: "Invite Change"
---


**Clarify the reason for change and invite people to participate.**

Inviting rather than imposing change helps reduce resistance and enables people to choose for themselves.

When making the invitation:

-   be transparent about the reason for the change
-   clarify expectations and constraints
-   avoid coercion or manipulation
-   acknowledge any skepticism and doubts

Include the people involved and affected in regular evaluation of outcomes.
