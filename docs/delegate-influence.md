title: "Delegate Influence"
---


Decentralize power to influence within defined constraints. Enable people to decide and act for themselves in response to organizational drivers.

The delegator supports people in delivering value by:

- defining domains of accountability and autonomy clearly
- ensuring ongoing learning and development
- providing support as needed

Adjust constraints incrementally, considering capabilities, reliability and outcome.

Decentralize as much as possible, retain as much influence as necessary.
