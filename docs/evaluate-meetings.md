---


**Take time for learning at the end of each meeting or workshop.**

Reflect on interactions, celebrate successes and share suggestions for improvement before closing the meeting.

-   reserve 5 minutes for 1 hour, and 15 minutes for a full-day workshop
-   record learning and review it before the next meeting

Short formats you can use:

-   more of/less of/start/stop/keep
-   positive/critical/suggested improvements

-   effectiveness and format
-   facilitation and participation
-   emotional tone
-   appreciations and achievements (I liked...)
