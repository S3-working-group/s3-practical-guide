title: "Peer Feedback"
---


Invite a peer to give you some constructive feedback on:

-   your performance in a role
-   your general participation and contribution
-   any specific aspect you may be interested in

Considerations:

-   invite peers to take some time to prepare
-   invite both **appreciations** and **actionable improvement suggestions**
-   inquire to better understand the feedback, and avoid discussing or judging it
-   decide for yourself what you will do with feedback you receive
