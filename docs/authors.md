## Our Commitment to You

We dedicate a part of our time and money to create free resources about Sociocracy 3.0 as part of our ongoing commitment to make sociocracy and related ideas more accessible to the wider world. 

There's an overlap between what we give away for free and how we make a living. Besides our work co-developing Sociocracy 3.0, we also sell consulting, facilitation, coaching and mentoring services, and design and delivery courses and events about, but not limited to Sociocracy 3.0. 

You can always rely on the the Practical Guide as being the current and authoritative description of Sociocracy 3.0, which will always be available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

On top of that, we make all the content of this website and all the materials on the Resources page available under the same license. 

We share new documentation we create, describing and explaining about S3 patterns and how they can be applied, in the Practical Guide and on the Sociocracy 3.0 website, when those documents are in a state of readiness that we are happy with. 

To find out how you can contribute to the development of S3, go to <https://sociocracy30.org/contribute/>
