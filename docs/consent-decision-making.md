title: "Consent Decision Making"
---



**A (facilitated) group process for decision making: invite objections, and consider information and knowledge revealed to further evolve proposals or existing agreements.**

Proposals become <dfn data-info="Agreement: An agreed upon guideline, process or protocol designed to guide the flow of value.">agreements</dfn> when they are considered _good enough for now and safe enough to try_ until the next review.

Unresolved <dfn data-info="Objection: A _reason_ why doing something stands in the way of (more) effective response to an organizational driver (i.e. an organizational requirement).">objections</dfn> prevent proposals from becoming agreements.

Withholding objections can harm the objectives of a team or organization.

### Implicit Contract of Consent

1.   In the absence of objections to an agreement, I intend to follow through on the agreement to the best of my ability.
2.   I agree to share objections as I become aware of them.
