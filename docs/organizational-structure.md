Organizational structure is the actual arrangement of <a href="glossary.html#entry-domain" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Domain: A distinct area of responsibility and authority within an organization.">domains</a> and their connections. It reflects where power to influence is located, and the channels through which information and influence flow.

Continuously evolve your organization's structure to:

-   support the continuous <a href="glossary.html#entry-flow-of-value" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Flow of Value: Deliverables traveling through an organization towards customers or other stakeholders.">flow of value</a>
-   enable effective collaboration around dependencies
-   ensure information is available to those who need it
-   distribute resources and power to influence as required

The basic building blocks for organizational structure are interdependent, connected domains.

Domains can be linked to form a hierarchy or a **heterarchy** (a.k.a. complex adaptive system, or network, where multiple functional structures can co-exist).

SociocracyÂ 3.0 describes a variety of **structural patterns** to grow organizational structure.

-   S3's structural patterns apply to different layers of abstraction
-   different structural patterns serve different <a href="glossary.html#entry-organizational-driver" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Organizational Driver: Any situation where the organization&#x27;s members have a motive to respond because they anticipate that doing so would be beneficial for the organization (by helping to generate value, eliminate waste or avoid undesirable risks or consequences).">drivers</a>
-   structural patterns can be adapted and combined as needed
-   more patterns are out there and will be discovered
