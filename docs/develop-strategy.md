title: "Develop Strategy"
---


_A **strategy** is a high level approach for how people will create value to successfully account for a domain._

It is usually more effective if a team or role keeper lead in developing their own strategy.

A strategy often includes a description of the <dfn data-info="Intended Outcome: The expected result of an agreement, action, project or strategy.">intended outcome</dfn> of implementing that strategy.

As the <dfn data-info="Delegator: An individual or group delegating a domain to other(s) to be accountable for.">delegator</dfn> shares accountability for <dfn data-info="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization.">domains</dfn> they delegate, it's valuable they review a <dfn data-info="Delegatee: An individual or group accepting accountability for a domain delegated to them.">delegatee's</dfn> strategy, to check for potential impediments and suggest ways it could be improved.

A strategy is a shared agreement between delegator(s) and delegatee(s) that is regularly reviewed and updated as necessary (*pivot or persevere*)
