title: "Agree On Values"
---



**Intentionally evolve the culture in your organization.**

_**Values** are valued principles that guide behavior. Values define scope for action and ethical constraints._

-   each member brings their own values to an organization based on personal experiences and beliefs
-   a team or organization may **choose to collectively adopt values** to guide their collaboration

Values offer guidance to determine appropriate action, even in the absence of explicit <dfn data-info="Agreement: An agreed upon guideline, process or protocol designed to guide the flow of value.">agreements</dfn>.

Collectively adopting a set of values supports the effectiveness of an organization:

-   reduces potential for **misunderstanding**
-   helps to **align** decision making and action
-   **attracts new members, partners and customers** who are aligned with the organization

Chosen values are an agreement that benefits from **regular review**.
