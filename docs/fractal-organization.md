Creating a fractal organization can enable a large network to rapidly respond to changing contexts.

If necessary, the pattern can be repeated to connect multiple fractal organizations into one.

## Prerequisites

A fractal organization can be formed either by multiple in(ter-)dependent organizations which share a common (primary) <a href="glossary.html#entry-organizational-driver" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Organizational Driver: Any situation where the organization&#x27;s members have a motive to respond because they anticipate that doing so would be beneficial for the organization (by helping to generate value, eliminate waste or avoid undesirable risks or consequences).">driver</a>, or by multiple branches, departments, or projects within a larger organization.

These <a href="glossary.html#entry-constituent" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Constituent: A team (e.g. a circle, team, department, branch, project or organization) who delegate authority to a representative to act on their behalf in other team or organizations.">constituents</a> (i.e. organizations, branches, departments or projects) need to share at least some – and typically most – functional <a href="glossary.html#entry-domain" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Domain: A distinct area of responsibility and authority within an organization.">domains</a> (e.g. accounting, product management, or development).

## Tiers

A fractal organization has at least three tiers:

- first tier: the **constituents** (i.e. organizations, branches, departments or projects)
- second tier: **function-specific [delegate circles](delegate-circle.html)** to share learning and to make and evolve agreements on behalf of function-specific domains
-  third tier: a **cross-functional delegate circle** to make and evolve agreements in response to drivers affecting the overall body of constituents

## Forming a Fractal Organization

1.  Forming the **second tier:** In each constituent, the members of each common (and significant) functional domain, decide who of them will represent them in a **function-specific delegate circle**, where they share knowledge and learning, and contribute toward making and evolving agreements. Representatives are selected for a limited term (after which a new selection is made).
2.  Forming the **third tier:** second-tier delegate circles each select a delegate to form the **cross-functional delegate circle**.

## Impact on the organization(s)

Each constituent:

- gains access to a wide array of experience, wisdom and skills to increase effectiveness and innovation.
- can share resources, infrastructure and experience with other constituents according to capacity and need

The second and third tier:

- can test decisions simultaneously across multiple instances of a function-specific domain, providing extensive feedback and rapid learning
- organize, align and steer the whole system while preserving autonomy and agency of the individual constituents
