title: "Peer Review"
---


**Support each other to learn and grow in the roles and teams you serve in.**

The role keeper — or team — leads the peer review by setting up the process, and by speaking first in each step.

Ensure you invite people with complementary perspectives to contribute to the review, and a [facilitator](facilitate-meetings.html).

For both appreciations and improvement suggestions, ensure you consider the following aspects:

-   The **value** the delegatee brought to the organization by accounting for the <dfn data-info="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization.">domain</dfn>.
-   The role keeper’s or team’s **work processes**, and their **collaboration** with the <dfn data-info="Delegator: An individual or group delegating responsibility for a domain to other(s).">delegator</dfn> and with other relevant stakeholders, and – in the case of a team - with each other.
-   How well the **delegator** takes care of their responsibilities.
-   The **design of the domain** itself (and potentially the design of other related domains).
-   The role keeper’s or team’s **competencies and skills** in relation to the domain.
-   The **<dfn data-info="Strategy: A high level approach for how people will create value to successfully account for a domain.">strategy</dfn>** the role keeper or team follows to account for this domain.
