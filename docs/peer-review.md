The role keeper — or team — leads the peer review by setting up the process, and by speaking first in each step.

Ensure you invite people with complementary perspectives to contribute to the review, and a [facilitator](facilitate-meetings.html).

For both appreciations and improvement suggestions, ensure you consider the following aspects:

-   The **value** the delegatee brought to the organization by accounting for the <a href="glossary.html#entry-domain" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Domain: A distinct area of responsibility and authority within an organization.">domain</a>.
-   The role keeper’s or team’s **work processes**, and their **collaboration** with the <a href="glossary.html#entry-delegator" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Delegator: An individual or group delegating responsibility for a domain to other(s).">delegator</a> and with other relevant stakeholders, and – in the case of a team - with each other.
-   How well the **delegator** takes care of their responsibilities.
-   The **design of the domain** itself (and potentially the design of other related domains).
-   The role keeper’s or team’s **competencies and skills** in relation to the domain.
-   The **<a href="glossary.html#entry-strategy" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Strategy: A high level approach for how people will create value to successfully account for a domain.">strategy</a>** the role keeper or team follows to account for this domain.
