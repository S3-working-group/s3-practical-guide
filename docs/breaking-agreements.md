Breaking <a href="glossary.html#entry-agreement" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Agreement: An agreed-upon guideline, process, protocol or policy designed to guide the flow of value.">agreements</a> is sometimes **necessary** but may come at a **cost** to the community.

Be accountable:

-   **clean up** disturbances
-   **follow up** as soon as possible with those affected
-   **change the agreement** instead of repeatedly breaking it
