title: "Navigate Via Tension"
---


**Identify and account for organizational drivers.**

**All members** bring awareness to what might help or harm the organization, and aim to account for drivers in an effective way. 

A **tension** is a personal experience: a symptom of dissonance between an individual's perception of a situation, and their expectations (or preferences). 




**Challenges and opportunities** for an organization are revealed as people become aware of tension they experience in relation to them.

To **discover drivers**, look behind tension and describe what's happening and what's needed. Sometimes an inquiry reveals misconceptions and the tension goes away.

Awareness of **organizational drivers** can be passed to an appropriate domain to be addressed.
