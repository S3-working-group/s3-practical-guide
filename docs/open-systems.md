An organization can benefit from intentionally communicating with and learning from others.

Acknowledging its interdependence, an organization can consciously invite **outside information, influence or skills** to assist with making decisions and to support collective learning.



-   **External experts** can offer an outside perspective and bring knowledge, understanding and skills
-   **Representatives of affected parties** can inform and influence decision making in ways that benefit overall objectives (see Those Affected Decide)
