**Prepare in advance to make meetings more effective.**

Some considerations for successfully preparing a meeting:

- clarify and communicate the <dfn data-info="Driver: A personâ€™s or a group&apos;s motive for responding to a specific situation.">driver</dfn> for, and <dfn data-info="Intended Outcome: The expected result of an agreement, action, project or strategy.">intended outcome</dfn> of the meeting
- decide who to invite
- create an agenda
- schedule the meeting enough in advance, so people have time to prepare
- choose an appropriate duration for the meeting
- be clear who will [facilitate the meeting](facilitate-meetings.html), who will take minutes and who will take care of any follow-up

### Preparing an Agenda

Involve people in preparing and prioritizing an agenda and send it out in advance

For each agenda item agree on:

- the driver
- the intended outcome
- the process
- the time you want to spend on it
- what people need to do to prepare

### Support the Participants' Preparation

- consider what can be done in advance to prepare for the meeting
- notify people about any expectations and prerequisites
- make any resources available that people may need for preparation

### As a participant

- consider the pattern [Artful Participation](artful-participation.html)
- review the agenda and consider how you can contribute to each item
- bring up objections to an agenda, and if possible resolve them before the meeting
- review improvement suggestions from the last meeting's evaluation and consider how **you** might act on them
