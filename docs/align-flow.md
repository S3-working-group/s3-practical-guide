**Flow of value:** Deliverables traveling through an organization towards customers or other stakeholders.

Achieve and maintain alignment of flow through the continuous evolution of an organization's body of <a href="glossary.html#entry-agreement" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Agreement: An agreed-upon guideline, process, protocol or policy designed to guide the flow of value.">agreements</a>:

-   ensure all decisions affecting the flow of value actually support the flow of value
-   enable people with relevant skills and knowledge to influence decisions
-   make available any helpful information
-   aim for shorter feedback loops to amplify learning.

When decision-making is conducted close to where value is created, and the flow of information supports the continuous and steady flow of value, the potential for accumulation of waste is reduced.
