-   may be self-organizing, or guided by a [coordinator](coordinator.html) chosen by the delegator

-   benefits from a clearly defined <a href="glossary.html#entry-domain" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Domain: A distinct area of responsibility and authority within an organization.">domain</a>
