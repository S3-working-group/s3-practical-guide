A helping team:

-   is a way for a <a href="glossary.html#entry-delegator" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Delegator: An individual or group delegating responsibility for a domain to other(s).">delegator</a> to expand their capacity
-   may be self-organizing, or guided by a [coordinator](coordinator.html) chosen by the delegator
-   is governed by the delegator
-   benefits from a clearly defined <a href="glossary.html#entry-domain" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision-making within an organization.">domain</a>

Members of the helping team:

-   can object to the delegator's decisions that affect them
-   can add items to the delegator's <a href="glossary.html#entry-governance-backlog" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Governance Backlog: A visible, prioritized list of items (drivers) that are related to governing a domain and require attention.">governance backlog</a>
-   may be invited to select a [representative](representative.html) to participate in the governance decision-making of the delegator
