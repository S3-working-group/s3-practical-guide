**Bring together a team of equivalent people with the mandate to execute on a specific set of requirements defined by a delegator.**

A helping team: 

-   is a way for a <dfn data-info="Delegator: An individual or group delegating a domain to other(s) to be accountable for.">delegator</dfn> to expand their capacity
-   may be self-organizing, or guided by a [coordinator](coordinator.html) chosen by the delegator
-   is governed by the delegator
-   benefits from a clearly defined <dfn data-info="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization.">domain</dfn>

Members of the helping team:

-   can object to the delegator's decisions that affect them
-   can add items to the delegator's governance <dfn data-info="Backlog: A list of (often prioritized) uncompleted work items (deliverables), or (drivers) that need to be addressed.">backlog</dfn>
-   may be invited to select a [representative](representative.html) to participate in the governance decision making of the delegator
