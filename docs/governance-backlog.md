<div class="card summary"><div class="card-body">A <strong>governance backlog</strong> is a visible, prioritized list of items (drivers) that are related to governing a domain and require attention.
</div></div>

A governance backlog contains:

-   matters requiring a decision
-   proposals to create and consider
-   selecting people for roles

**Note:** Upcoming reports and agreements due review are usually added directly to the agenda (rather than the backlog).
