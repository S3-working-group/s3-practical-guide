</div></div>

_A **governance backlog** is a visible, prioritized list of items (drivers and/or requirements) relating to the governance of a domain._

A governance <a href="glossary.html#entry-backlog" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Backlog: A list of (often prioritized) uncompleted work items (typically a deliverable, requirement or a driver) that need to be addressed.">backlog</a> is at the core of any reliable and transparent system for governance. Keeping a governance backlog helps with planning regular [governance meetings](governance-meeting.html). It’s also useful for deciding which items are best addressed in a dedicated meeting, or in other regular meetings such as product meetings, [planning meetings](planning-and-review-meetings.html) or [retrospectives](retrospective.html).

A governance backlog contains information about:

-   matters requiring a decision
-   proposals to create and consider
-   selecting people for roles

An item in a (prioritized) governance backlog typically provides information about: 

- the <a href="glossary.html#entry-organizational-driver" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Organizational Driver: Any situation where the organization&#x27;s members have a motive to respond because they anticipate that doing so would be beneficial for the organization (by helping to generate value, eliminate waste or avoid undesirable risks or consequences).">driver</a> that needs addressing (and the <a href="glossary.html#entry-requirement" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Requirement: A need or desire considered necessary to fulfill to respond to an organizational driver, adequately or as a suitable incremental next step.">requirement</a> – for drivers that have been determined as relevant and a priority)
- the next step(s) for addressing the item (e.g. [determine requirement](determine-requirements.html), form a proposal, [test a proposal](consent-decision-making.html), [review an existing agreement](evaluate-and-evolve-agreements.html), [select someone for a role](role-selection.html), including an estimate of the time required
- other interdependent items (including work items), as well as any other relevant information, e.g. reference to proposals, domain descriptions, etc)
- who added the item to the backlog (for clarification/questions)
- a due date (if necessary)
- a way of visualizing rank or priority (see [Prioritize Backlogs](prioritize-backlogs.html)).
