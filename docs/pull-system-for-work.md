title: "Pull-System For Work"
---


**People pull in new work items when they have capacity (instead of having work pushed or assigned to them.**

Prioritize pending work items to ensure that important items are worked on first.

Pulling in work prevents overloading the system, especially when [work in progress (WIP) per person or team is limited](limit-work-in-progress.html).
