**Deliver value in complex and competitive environments through _decentralization_ (of resources and influence) and _direct interaction_ between those creating value and the customers they serve.**

Groups in the periphery:

-   deliver value in direct exchange with the outside world (customers, partners, communities, municipalities etc.) 
-   steward the monetary resources and steer the organization

The center provides internal services to support the organization.

Domains are linked as required to flow information and influence, and to support collaboration around dependencies.
