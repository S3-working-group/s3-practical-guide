**_Focus your daily work on value delivery, so that the stuff that needs doing to achieve your purpose is done._**

Essential patterns to help you achieve this:

-   [Clarify and Develop Domains](clarify-and-develop-domains.html) – Clarifying the area of influence, activity and decision-making that a team, or person in a role is responsible for, enables them to understand the value they are expected to deliver.
-   [Respond to Organizational Drivers](respond-to-organizational-drivers.html) – Understanding what’s necessary to respond to and why, and ensuring those things are taken care of, maximizes potential for creating value.
-   [Prioritize Backlogs](prioritize-backlogs.html) –  When you prioritize your list of work items by value, it is obvious which ones need to be worked on first. 
-   [Limit Work In Progress](limit-work-in-progress.html) –  Limiting the number of concurrent work items for people and teams, helps to maintain a steady flow of value and encourages collaboration when work is blocked.
-   [Daily Standup](daily-standup.html) – A Daily Standup provides the space for a team to organize how they will create value during the day ahead
-   [Test Arguments Qualify as Objections](test-arguments-qualify-as-objections.html) – When you test each argument brought forward against a decision for whether or not it reveals worthwhile improvements or unwanted  consequences, you keep your work focused on value and avoid getting derailed by unfounded opinions and personal preferences.
